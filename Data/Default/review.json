Only a different sort of resurrection; one external of the frame and achievable any time that an individual makes the decision to sacrifice their own sight, and replace it with the eye of Abbas' lens."

He would have loved the low rumble of snores that filled the auditorium in surround sound. To some extent, he might have even appreciated the steady stream of walk-outs, or my decision to take a short walk halfway through and then watch the rest of the film while standing at the back of the room.\r\n\r\nREAD THE FULL REVIEW ON INDIEWIRE"

Had I seen this with zero foreknowledge (minus the initial, proof-of-concept frame using \"The Hunters in the Snow\"), odds are I would have moderately enjoyed it at face value, as Kiarostami's version of something like Benning's 13 Lakes (which I did in fact moderately enjoy). Each shot is beautifully composed, and while I might have marveled at how frequently animals seem to spontaneously provide a mini-narrative, or noticed that some of their movements don't look entirely natural, the degree of manipulation involved almost certainly would not have occurred to me. Once you know what's going on, though—and Kiarostami (or someone, anyway) makes a point of telling you up front—elements that would otherwise have been merely pleasing become exhilarating. Frame 12, for example, expertly simulates the sensation of clouds intermittently blocking the sun, even though the sky isn't visible; instead of thinking \"Wow, gorgeous effect, he got lucky there,\" I found myself pondering how many similar digital tweaks escape my (conscious) notice, simply because they aren't foregrounded the way they are here. Other frames found me playing a fascinating game of Spot The Original Photo, as they're so gratifyingly busy and/or so apparently focused on moving objects that a compelling still-life version is hard to discern. (By contrast, Frame 15—the tourists viewing the Eiffel Tower—was the least interesting to me, precisely because its pre-manipulated state is so obvious.) The amount of work that must have gone into this seems insane—it's like sitting down for years of post-production and fashioning a Roy Andersson movie from a nature doc. I confess that the idea began to feel exhausted for me by around Frame 20, and that for some reason I didn't have the overwhelming emotional response to the final frame that many others have. (Maybe Andrew Lloyd Webber is just too kitschy for me.) But seeing Kiarostami still way out on the cutting edge, some five decades into his extraordinary career, makes his passing hurt all the more. He clearly had plenty left to give us."

The beginning of Abbas Kiarostami's final film, depicting 'The Hunters in the Snow' from 1565, is a birth of the universe moment from which all of cinema bellowed out, much like the smoke stacks given life as the painting begins to be (selectively) animated. Each image is a complete existence, contextualized by sound and living things passing in and out of frame, a reminder of what is beyond and what is visible. They're encased in time - frozen, forever the same, and yet they move with startling unpredictability. Each 'frame' is constructed out of many, many individual frames, but their fixed nature doesn't cancel a potent sense of replication - a lack of capture giving way to manipulation. Their jittery, robotic details are a sublime representation of mimicking what is possible - that we can go out with a camera and capture the real thing. These photos and moments surely affected Kiarostami, and he let them free. Its ending might be as close as anyone has ever gotten to solving the enigma of the cinema. Essential."

		"ReviewText": "sajad\nParadoxes are built into the very technology of cinema, where time is measured in units of physical distance. The title of 24 Frames, Abbas Kiarostami’s final feature, is, of course, a reference to the broadly accepted standard framerate of filming, but it is also an invocation of “frame” as a more holistic notion of composition and intent. Each of the 24 images that the director expands is a compelling snapshot given new, hyperreal life with in-camera effects and animations that create motion in occasionally eerie, jittery ways that call attention to the artifice of cinema. From the outset, in which Kiarostami digitally animates Pieter Bruegel the Elder’s The Hunters in the Snow with smoky chimneys, fluttering birds and herded livestock, this is a radical break from the director’s usual form; soon, we are treated to wild sights like slurred, oneiric black-and-white images that recall the work of Aleksei German, or an image of a deeply silhouetted tree and bird that look less like backlit real objects than the cut-out shadow animations of Lotte Reiniger.\r\n\r\n\t\tBy the same token, Kiarostami’s approach fits well within his long-standing postmodern deconstruction of the barriers between reality and cinema, with emphasis on the ways that the closer cinema gets to looking like the real world, the easier it is to spot the shimmering moment where the mirage reveals itself. Kiarostami’s speciality, of a camera gazing out at the world from within the intimate but distancing second screen of a car window, crops up in Frame 2, albeit with the added subversion of the real of the window itself being a fake, crafted to create illusions of movement. Kiarostami produces some jaw-dropping images in this: a cow sleeping on a beach as tide rolls in, mist and salt air casting a haze over pallid skies; a deer munching on grass before a gunshot sends its sprawling into the one dark area of an otherwise bright frame; a silhouette of a bird on a window blind brightening and dimming with the sun moving in and out of clouds, giving the bird a ghostly quality. In one shot, an abandoned building coated in the high-contrast white of streaks of bird shit is filmed in such a way as to only leave a small quadrilateral of window space through which to see pigeons gathering on a street. At times, the strange digital textures and subtly weird pace of object movement recalls some similar in-camera digital trickery in Twin Peaks: The Return, finding a tonally different but thematically similar exploration of time in the possibilities afforded by new film technology. Gorgeous and elegiac, the film is the perfect send-off for one of cinema’s great innovators, one final analysis of time and metaphysics from a director who managed to deliver it after his own death."

Through Kaji we celebrate the stoic and prevailing strength of ideals, the resonance of a resilient conscience and voice for truth and compassion. Described by a Japanese villager as a ''Paragon of virtue'', Kaji's quest to reunite with his love Michiko is an all conquering force that echoes right past the films final frame.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tThis final chapter sees Kaji leading his remaining followers, and other Japanese soldiers he meets along the way through dense forest, fighting for survival against Russian troops and Chinese militia and avoiding enemy capture, ultimately leading to imprisonment in a Russian POW camp. It's here where he finds things have come full circle from the labour manager position he once held to the harsh conditions of Soviet communist ideals that no longer mirror the ones he had placed faith in. A riveting scene involving impassioned pleas to a room of Russian officials, which is constantly misconstrued by an unreliable translator is simply heartbreaking, as is the treatment of his comrades by Japanese fascists in the very same camp.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tSome astounding cinematography was noticeable in this chapter, with the application of Dutch tilts to enhance many key scenes including hunger and violence, some freeze frames used in an early battle sequence would also be used in Samurai Rebellion years later, whilst reflections in rivers and the use of shadows in the POW camp added a rich texture to the visual aesthetic, which is enhanced further by the dramatic score. This film belongs to Tatsuya Nakadai as Kaji, which is surely one of the most committed performances in all of Japanese cinema. The gravity of every trial and tribulation is felt through his eyes and performance, and the film would not be the powerful statement it is without his talent.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tSo after enduring 10 hours of psychological exhaustion through the examination of 'The Human Condition', I can in no way deny that this is the greatest cinematic achievement I have ever experienced. Masaki Kobayashi is a bold visionary and auteur that I can only compare to Stanley Kubrick, and whilst I adore his other films and consider them perfection, this film is his crowning achievement.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tWelcome to the No#1 position on my All-time favourite film list!"

		"ReviewText": "A Soldier's Prayer (1961), opens with Kaiji and a few stragglers on the run. Along the way they pick civilians and several die from hunger, poisonous mushrooms, and suicide. Once they emerge from the forest they are besieged by peasant forces and must continue on as a few of the group are killed by the peasant forces. From there they encounter a group of fifty Japanese army holdouts who are attempting to resume combat in alliance with Chiang Kai-shek, whom they believe will be supported by American forces, in a civil war against Russian-backed Communist Chinese. Kaji, a believer in pacifism and socialism, rejects this strategy as misguided and doomed to failure. Eventually, Kaji and a group of Japanese soldiers, whose number has grown to fifteen, fight through Russian patrols and find a encampment of women and old men who seek their protection. It is here that they surrender rather than put the group in danger of death or retribution if they fight. And here the series comes back to a forced labor camp for POWs and many of the themes from the first film are revisited. Kaji and his protégé Terada resist the Japanese officers who run their work camp in cooperation with Soviet forces. While such resistance amounts to no more than picking through the Russian's' garbage for scraps of food and wearing gunnysacks to protect them from increasingly colder weather, Kaji is branded a saboteur and judged by a Soviet tribunal to harsh labor. With a corrupt translator and no other means of talking to the Russian officers with whom he feels ideological sympathies, Kaji becomes increasingly disillusioned by conditions in the camp and with Communist orthodoxy. When Terada is driven to exhaustion and death by harsh treatment from the collaborating officer Kirihara, Kaji decides to kill the man and then escape the camp alone. He ends up collapsed in a snow storm speaking his wife's name."

		"ReviewText": "There’s a scene about 515 minutes into this nine and half hour movie where our protagonist, Kaji - having fully made the transition from manager of a Japanese prison labor camp to POW of a Soviet prison labor camp - comes before the Russian management of the camp to answer for his attempts at democratizing the POWs.\r\n\r\n\t\tKaji is, as far as he knows himself, a socialist. Many times throughout the six part filmic cycle he is referred to as a “Red”. At the very least he’s actively against the monarchical fascism of his own country, Japan, who he has been forced to go to war for. But here in the labor camp he has seen none of the class equalization that he admires about Soviet rhetoric. (And this is a buried theme in the work, no ISM will save us as long as humanity remains base and greedy and vindictive. What needs to change is not our form of governance, but the compassionless nature of our institutions and the leaders they enable.)\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tAnd now here, finally, is Kaji's chance to make this profound moral argument to his Russian captors. To engage in dialogue about the arc of human governance. To appeal to the angels of their own socialist rhetoric which, in theory, lean towards humanism.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tAnd then he’s given a shit translator.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tHe is not understood. He is in fact misunderstood. And he cannot understand them. Language, Russian and Japanese, is all just sounds without meaning. He’s a mute child before his Russian overlords. Wet-eyed and desperate and imploring and angry. A gesticulating buffoon.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tEverything he has experienced across all these years of war, all the lessons of leading human beings in times of crisis and hardship. His struggle to treat the human beings in his care with some kind of greater grace. His assertions that being kind is actually the most productive strategy of all. It’s all meaningless. He is not heard. He has never been heard, not in any real sense.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tHe looks like a beggar in his makeshift gunnysack clothing. His ethical code, honed to perfection; his belief in humanity; his elevation as a moral hero; nothing, nothing. Meaningless. Meaningless. Before the Russians he is a caricature. A dirty “fascist samurai”.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tIt is the apex scene to Masaki Kobayashi’s sprawling masterwork. Though we have seen enslavement, rape, murder, war, dehumanization, theft of livelihood, and more, this... the not being heard; the negation of all Kaji has learned and believed and struggled to implement... this is the darkest event of all. Because filmmaker Kobayashi himself has spent huge amounts of resources and many years making an almost ten hour dramatic moral mountain top of a movie and now Masaki is telling us that it all amounts to nothing. Those who need to hear the message will not.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tYou. Me. Him. His fictions. All that we invest in. We are unheard.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tIs it any wonder it ends as it does? We may ask ourselves, why have we come all this way for this ending? We may be left soul sick by it. But we know in our hearts... it’s the only true ending for a man like Kaji. And we also know that it doesn’t lessen Kaji, this ending.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tBecause, still, after all this, it is better to die because you believed in humanity, than to live as if you did not. Such a belief may not save one human life, but in the arc of history, it will save lives.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tI know I’m prone to hyperbole on this site. I just love movies, all movies, and I get excited by them, by the best and worst of them, but I think I’m being clear-eyed when I say, Masaki Kobayashi’s collective filmic cycle, THE HUMAN CONDITION, is one of the greatest movies of the twentieth century, and it far, far outpaces much better known works (at least better known here in the West) in almost every regard."

Between trekking through dejected landscapes and suffering in harsh labour camps, the limits of the human spirit are pushed to the point of total collapse; overwhelmed and deprived as the ever insurmountable stream of challenges finally consume the self - leading to perhaps the most anguishing, unforgettable movie ending I’ve ever seen. Kobayashi’s incredible skill and determination exhibited throughout this entire saga is really astounding; creating possibly the greatest, most accomplished epic film series of all time."

I doubt I could continue another day.'\r\n\r\n\t\tThe Human Condition III is the hopeless odyssey of the heart freezing in the hopeful blizzard of love.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tKobayashi's epic saga of a man who embodies the endurance of the human spirit reaches its spiritual zenith and physical nadir in the third instalment. On the physical level, it is the story of an army deserter wading through enemy territory to reach home and see his wife. Kaji hastens through forests, plains, cornfields, villages, and prison camps, equally helped and hindered by the people drawn to the selfless warmth under his fiery-cold self-confidence. He brushes away the misfortunes happening to him along the way and focuses only on the destination buried in the snowstorm of his own footsteps. On the spiritual level, the movie is about the soul's quest of finding the answer for the most compound theme the 10-hour epic poses: the human condition.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t'Is that the universal solution to human dilemmas: \"It can't be helped\"?'\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tWhile Part 1 was more about the exposition of humanism's philosophy and Part 2 more about purely narrative events, Part 3 seems to cement its philosophy in its literal narrative – and deservedly etch its name into cinematic history.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tThe film attains its technical perfection here: the desolate locations and extended silences both reflect the hopelessness of Kaji's mission. His visions of his wife and his inner monologues talking to her breathe life into the phantom of hope in his heart – if only for so long. He walks the endless crossroads of life and knows he goes in circles. He does not get any external confirmation that his kind deeds bring fortune to others; instead, he is cursed, spat on, taken prisoner, and declared a 'fascist samurai'. All that he stood and stands for seems to be in vain. His selfless deeds go unnoticed; or worse, are misinterpreted – and he suffers for them.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tThere is an interesting paradox the movie establishes from the start: Kaji thought beforehand that the answer to the human condition was selfless acts of kindness. The feedback was never positive, but he somehow carried the embers of hope within him and managed to re-ignite the flame over and over again. Here, however, his mission is a self-centered one, and his hope is drawn from thinking about his wife. It seems that the human condition is not focused on others but on the self – and the answer lies therein as well. The search for it is unglorified, and the journey calls for leaving behind every other value than that of finding the heart's long-lost home.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tThe odyssey of life is an impossible one. Whenever the spirit is high, the physical body seems to be at the lowest. Kaji's quest is the most poignant testament to the soul's perseverance in the harshest conditions. It is as a beggar wandering in the Siberian ice, starved, cold, alone, that Kaji finds the companion who could keep him warm. It is in the purifying frozen death of his body that he realizes the solution his heart has long since known. He embraces the vision of his wife with empty hands but a full heart, and understands that the real answer to the human condition has always been love.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t'I am still walking toward you. If you weren't waiting... I doubt I could continue another day.'"

It all comes back in circle for Kaji and now he is on the opposite side. He is faced with a corrupt translator, his own countrymen beating their own men while the Russians stopping them.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tWhat really gets to you is the final 30 minutes of this movie, the final straw that hits Kaji as he runs off in search for his wife and returning to her.

Much like Tolstoy, Kobayashi takes his time in unfurling this textured tapestry of moral contemplation. This final chapter of the Human Condition trilogy is a testament to the project as a whole; reconciling with the meaning of these films can feel as arduous as the journey it depicts. \r\n\r\n\t\tThe craftsmanship on display is irrefutably impressive and the starkness of it all is rather bewildering. Stripped of all colour and pageantry, the story rests solely on the central arc which meditates on the sacrifice of ideology in the face of survival. Whilst the presentation of conflict itself is stark and haunting, the moral ambiguity arising from an individual case of applied ethics feels intentionally opaque. The titular human condition ultimately appears to be one of immense suffering and persistent folly but then equally one of tenacious endurance. \r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tThe thoughts and feelings this has left me with continue to unwind in my mind, and I think I’ll be processing this for a while to come. For now I cannot honestly rate these. They stand outside of my personal ranking criteria. \r\n\t\tOne day the dust may settle, but for now I am enjoying the bleak intrigue of it all."

In spite of this, Kaiji is an excellent soldier and expert marksman. He considers deserting with another soldier under suspicion of leftist sympathies, but doesn't think it will ultimately lead to a return to his previous life with his wife Michiko. When a weak soldier commits suicide after intense bulling from the corporal in charge of training Kaiji demands disciplinary action and it is refused.

The new commanding officer is an old friend and asks Kaiji to train the new recruits--Kaiji agrees on one condition: that they are separated from the artillery veterans who dole out arbitrary and brutal beatings regularly. Kaiji is often at the end of such beatings for his men. In order to avoid conflicts between the two groups, the new recruit group is sent on a month long trench digging detail. A new war breaks out and they are over run by Russians and their tanks.

Sure, it's got structural similarities to Kubrick's film, with volume 3 detailing Kaji's torturous boot camp training (complete with a bathroom suicide), and volume 4 containing the trilogy's grand-scale battle sequence, but what makes Road to Eternity so great is Kaji finally coming into his own, understanding the 'whys' of his idealism, and understanding the necessity of sacrifice to fulfill his dream of a better world. It's here, on the doorstep of war, that Kaji comes to realize ideas alone cannot make progress, there must be bodies to contain them. It's a much more complicated spectrum of right and wrong as presented in No Greater Love, and the film benefits greatly from it.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tAnother plus for this middle installment (at least to a non-history buff) is the approachable way it presents another side of patriotism. The trilogy as a whole clearly has an anti-war/anti-fascism agenda, but manages to establish a dialogue between the sides and presents some insight (however negatively colored) as to the socio-political situation in Japan at the time. Kaji's struggles in boot camp allegorically detail the concept of nations warring and for what purpose, and by turning those ideas into characters, Kobayashi nurtures a fresh understanding of positions, reactions, and ramifications of humanism global role.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tThough its war scenes might not impress compared to films focused solely on realistic and action-oriented battle, Road to Eternity makes it clear that the firing of a gun or the throw of a grenade is an infinitesimally small portion of what war actually is. In other words, it does not betray its larger scope, and instead guides the viewer on, mirroring the emotional stress of No Greater Love's finale and promising yet another paradigm shift for Kaji, bleaker still."

Developing on the morality and compassion of No Greater Love, The Road to Eternity employs its themes to even greater effect as the focus is shifted inward on the structure of the training army; barely representing the combat of war as we see the soldiers repeatedly abused and Kaji’s optimism mature to form a more realistic and toughened perspective. For a saga that’s well over 9 hours in length it’s scope has so far proven to be entirely deserving; continually improving on its already virtual perfection as it provides a striking and often agonising portrayal of humanity through incredibly inhumane conditions."

It is incredibly easy to make the character into a myth, a legend, the perfect individual who never makes mistakes, who is equipped with the perfect moral code, and whose circumstances enable him to do 'absolute' good by everyone, every time. In short, into someone who doesn't exist.\r\n\r\n\t\tIt is equally easy to suffocate him in bloated heroics, breathing life into the kind of unthinking individual who headlessly rushes into battle – and comes out victorious amidst the heavy tank fire, one against a thousand, obviously. I continue to be fascinated by the character of Kaji in The Human Condition as he is neither of the above two.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tHe is not the 'mythical hero type', the ideal representation of our never-to-be-realized wish for purity. He realizes there is no such thing as a perfect deed and that doing 'the right thing' is dependent upon each situation. He rarely has the upper hand but tries to do his best his position allows for. There is always someone who is going to be unhappy with a decision, just as the world is not built up of ideal conditions where making a choice can bring ultimate good to everyone.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t'Never give up.

He has a strict moral code but knows when to chip off its edges and do something he would normally reject. He is not the meek do-gooder who is afraid to confront lest he offend the other. He is ready to use force, even in its physical manifestations, when it is a question of going on or letting your soul die. He is prepared to yell at a straggler and hit him until he stands back up so that he will pass training. He might hit a fellow soldier and order him to GET DOWN! so that he won't get shot to pieces on the battlefield.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t'To die here is a dog's death.'\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tHe is not the 'blind heroic type', the ideal representation of our never-to-be-realized wish for glory. He has no regard for romantic heroism, nor for garish patriotism. He knows there is nothing to be gained from putting it all on the line and diving into battle for his country when reality tells him otherwise. When you huddle in a trench in the middle of the open battlefield, with no ammunition left, your fellow soldiers dead not one step away from you, and the Soviet tanks wreaking havoc above – blind heroism will only get you so far.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t'I refuse to die.'\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tThere is no glory in uselessly dying for your country, and Kaji knows it. It doesn't change anything – it doesn't turn a lost battle around, nor does it bring back all those who died. Kaji is aware of all this as he stumbles into the battle-charred night, desperately hanging onto anything that could spell a new dawn for him and for humanity. He is not an ideal person, nor a hero of war, but he is the champion of the human spirit – and that is enough."

Multiple times Kaji reveals that the enemy is the army, but I think it’s important to specify what he means, not the literal Imperial Army of Japan, but rather the blindly radical, hysterically hyper masculine, and ultimately suicidal indoctrination that so many men had to endure at the hands of a ultra-militaristic regime. It’s the system that is the root cause of obedience soaked in hate, and it’s these wildly antagonistic and viscerally brutal sentiments that motivate every trigger squeezed, every hand raised in anger, and every bullet loaded and subsequently fired across the scorched land covered in fallen soldiers. \r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tIf to survive requires becoming a monster, is life worth living?

After the delirious master-class of Harakiri, the elegance of Samurai Rebellion and startling Kwaidan, Masaki Kobayashi has crushed my soul and moved me to tears with his greatest achievement - 'The Human Condition', and while I am only one third through a 10 hour epic journey, I am already willing to claim this as the greatest film I have ever seen.\r\n\r\n\t\tWithout the playful narrative structure of Harakiri, 'No Greater Love' delivers it's towering tale in a more conventional yet no less stately manner as the plot sees Kaji (Tatsuya Nakadai) dodging military conscription to instead take his humane labour theories and attempt to apply them in a brutal labour mining operation. His wife Michiko (Michiyo Aratama) who will follow him to the ends of the earth, deals with a solitary housewife existence as her husband is consumed by his insistence on bringing a sense of humanity to the harsh conditions that surround him.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tThe beginnings of a saga that over the next two films will see Kaji navigate many trials and tribulations in the face of wartime Japan, this first instalment features some of the most beautifully composed and photographed imagery of its period, towering and powerful performances by its talented cast especially by the two leads, and if that wasn't enough, it's complex and rich thematic tapestry explores a wealth of moral quandaries and psychological examinations of what it means to be 'human' that one can only be moved and crushed by its weight.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tI feel this film will never leave me, and I feel honoured to have been made privy to it's majesty. Criminally underrated, underseen and undervalued it would seem, that I feel the great need to champion this film by holding it high above all as arguably the greatest achievement of cinema, and while I am yet to see the other two instalments, this film alone is a worthy testament to the power and wonder of cinema."

The protagonist agrees to work at a remote mine in Manchuria to boost production through his theory that if the workers are treated humanely the production will increase in exchange for a military exemption. This allows him to marry his girlfriend-knowing that he won't be conscripted and leave her a widow. Kaiji is at odds with the corrupt and inhuman treatment of the Chinese labor by his mining company. It was shocking to me that this film could have been made without protests by right wing fanatics or fear of studio heads worrying about Japan's image. It clearly shows that Japanese companies used forced labor in China as well as \"comfort\" women and that many were war profiteers. At the end of this film, he has failed and has his military exemption revoked so that he is conscripted into the army."

You seem willing to pay the fare, no matter how high.'\r\n\r\n\t\tI'll never not be fascinated by the Japanese, their open-mindedness to cross-examine themselves as a nation and their selfless willingness to paint themselves in a less favorable light in movies. It is an act of infinite humility that elicits the most noble of reactions from me – my utmost respect.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tThe Human Condition's Kaji is of the same mindset: he is not blinded by patriotism for his country and sees the crimes his people have committed in an objective light. He doesn't distort reality for the worse but aims to alter the future of man – for the better. He thinks in universal terms and rejects the notion of taking sides. After all, humanism is not about two opposing sides but one collective. He transcends his country's deep-rooted and often toxic ideals, and treats each person as his equal – while WW2 rages on in another mindset, another place, another world. Another world because Kaji is alone in his: in a world driven by hunger for money and authority, he stands on the losing side with his undying hope – alone, but with his head held high.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tKaji doesn't act selflessly to satisfy any selfish motive lurking underneath, nor does he care what his Japanese kinsmen think about him as he establishes rapport with the Chinese laborers under his supervision and does everything in his power to improve their work environment. He rejects the use of any kind of physical force and instead tries to win the workers' trust by showing them that him being a Japanese does not matter in the least, because above all – he is a human being.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tUnfortunately, the world is not a fairytale painted in such warm colors. In reality, Kaji becomes accomplice to the Japanese officials' inhumane treatment of the laborers, and has no real power to stop the brutalities. One of the film's most harrowing scenes (and one that's easily top 20 for me) is the execution of several laborers charged with attempted escape.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t'If I don't save them, I'm no longer a human being.'\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tKaji is torn, desperate; the outcome seems to spell tragedy no matter how he acts. He has a quasi-choice: he can either stay a human being and release the convicts from the prison in secret – and risk being executed by his own employers. Or he can watch as they are all beheaded with the ironically emblematic samurai sword, and live with a warped conscience forever. Ideals vs reality clash – and the solution is the greatest trial of the human spirit yet.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tThe execution scene itself is a technical masterpiece. There are Dutch angles creating a dissonance as they get twisted back to horizontal just as the inhumanity begins. The shot composition is superb: the camera shows all the participants of the human condition within one frame – proponent, opposer, and victim alike – then cuts suddenly to an extreme close-up of Kaji's face and reveals the extreme pain he is buried under by one mere twitch of the eye.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tThere is a certain humility to Tatsuya Nakadai's portrayal of Kaji. He manages to capture all the internal torture of the character as we look into the well of his expressive eyes that drown in the blackness of the scene unfolding in front of them. Honestly, his performance is nothing short of hypnotic. The scene ends with the simplest yet most moving portrayal of the human spirit soaring as the laborers group together and start marching towards the guards in unison, shouting 'Murderers! Murderers!!!' A day has passed and I still get chills from those 5-10 minutes. Definitely peak cinema and the rawest, truest meditation on the strength of the human spirit.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tTaking into view the strictly literal events in The Human Condition, it is a story of failure; the unsuccessful strife of one man against his entire country's policy. At heart, however, it is a story of the human spirit's endurance and of an ever-present hope for a changeable future. Once you've caught the humanism train, you can either reach your destination or crash into the frozen wall of the human heart – it doesn't matter which, as long as you are on board. Because if you are, you know that your own heart is a thousand stations away from turning into the iceberg."

Maybe it's not an adage; maybe it's just a Terry Pratchett quote. Regardless, this film is painfully bleak a depiction of the noble struggle, and the concept of a good man fighting within a dirty, broken, ignoble, violent, oppressive regime for even a fraction of compassion is one that resonates, even if I am not a fraction of the human being Kaji is. Every facet described there--the concept, the resonance, and the fact that I am not worthy--makes this film all the more scathing, difficult, and powerful.\r\n\r\n\t\tThis nigh futile effort is repeatedly shown as Kaji walks through huge landscapes, a small, insignificant speck among huge forces. It's shown as he stands at the barbed wire barrier, seeming as much a prisoner as the POWs. It's shown in the frustration etched into his face. His few triumphs are all poisoned by the fact that they are triumphs for a system that he is fundamentally opposed to; he serves two masters. One master is his own conscience; the other master is his nation/company. He seeks a way forward that benefits both, but all this earns him is contempt from both sides. The prisoners do not trust him, and his superiors and associates have disdain for him.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tI can't say where this is going, but I cannot fathom what comes next is any happier. If the next film picks up where this one left off, Kaji's pacifism will be as tested as his socialism was in this one. I will come to it soon enough.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tDecember count: 64/100."

Kobayashi seemed to have a firm grasp on what being human means, but on the other side of the coin, he was acutely aware of what being human can lead to. So far (at least in the first installment of the trilogy), it seems Kobayashi is framing fear as the integral foil to humankind. Fear disrupts solidarity among the righteous, shackles the heart to hate, and imprisons free will for the sake of violent obedience.  \r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tPersonally, I did feel this film’s runtime throughout, as the 3 and a half-hour film felt (at multiple times) thematically redundant and occasionally a little too on the nose with its themes (the humanism train). I also think a consequence of the runtime is that side characters are given more screen time than they might’ve gotten in a 2-hour film, however I felt the characterization of most of them were quite flimsy. I wish Kobayashi had approached some of their motives and character traits with the same fragility and precision as he did the lead. Regardless of these issues, I never found myself completely uninterested or disengaged in the film, which is a soaring achievement for a film with this runtime. In conclusion: I’m excited to finish this trilogy.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t8.2 / 10 "

Kobayashi essentially says 'fuck the clan system dominating Japanese culture for centuries because the clan system sucks', and he advocates family ties and love as the eternal values our lives should be governed by instead.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tThe movie is impeccable on every front: its immense depth is matched by its clean, slick style. The narrative is engaging with a female character put in a central position as the one to make life-changing decisions for the whole family. The climax is set in the windy bleakness of the wheatfields and is every bit as raw and intense as befits our leading man.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tToshiro Mifune does not go out silently. Oh no. He goes out with a double bang. He is shot several times, yet gets back up in one last determined charge against the whole system with no more than a samurai sword and his fiery resolve in his hand. The camera is clearly mad about him and I share the sentiment. In his last scene, there is a neat reference to Kobayashi's The Human Condition as Mifune meditates on how the voice of one individual is always suppressed by the system, and he lets out a sigh, wondering: '[Is that the universal solution to human dilemmas?] It can't be helped.' For a fleeting moment, one can think otherwise – and that moment is all that matters in Samurai Rebellion."

Only to then see him become gleefully alive as he opens up the almost expressionistic empty rooms (in minimalism, clarity) of his grand home to achieve clear lines of battle sight and replace the lovely woven tatami mats for mats of rough hay, the better to sop up the blood that must be spilt underfoot.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tPerhaps there is a key in this moment of Mifune’s resigned joy.

As the values fall, so does the family, the group dissolves, leaving individuals alone, in a hopeless fight against society.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tRevolt against a higher institution is a theme that director Kobayashi and writer Hashimoto had previously explored in Harakiri, but this time they take their idea farther, trying to achieve something even more daring and rebellious than they did before, adding more characters and focusing not only on the male perspective, but also the women’s one, which was something that sets the movie aside from its contemporary works.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tGiven those points I would have expected to like Samurai Rebellion even more than Harakiri, yet, while still appreciating it and loving the work Kobayashi did with blocking and composition, I found the structure and the writing of the latter to be more interesting for me, whereas I found problems with the pacing of this one that I didn’t find within Harakiri."

I told you that if you broke it, I would kill you. You've betrayed me!\"\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tWoven within Kwaidan's three-hour runtime there is a solid horror anthology, but it takes a frustratingly long time to get to the best parts. Which caused me to have to muscle through it over the course of a couple of days.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t(Quick Hits) ... Spoilers:\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t- Part One - Black Hair was my least favorite since it took a solid 35 minutes to get to the ending, where something interesting but silly finally happens. The story is about a guy who leaves his wife to be with another woman, but years later goes back to his first wife\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t- It was a chilling reveal when we see that she is really dead, but I could not help myself from laughing at the attack of the killer hair part\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t- Part Two - The Woman in the Snow was another slow burn without much payoff IMHO. It is about a guy that gets rescued from a snowstorm by a mysterious woman in white, but must vow to never tell anyone\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t- So the guy apparently marries this same spirit and eventually breaks his vow by telling her that his life was spared by her. She gets mad at him for this and disappears. Shame on him for having a recollection I guess\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t- I loved the snowy setting for this one, and there were a ton of great visuals throughout all of Kwaidan. It reminded me of 'Mishima' with how it was shot on these sets with these stunning painted backgrounds\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t- This is when the intermission comes in, and thankfully the second half of Kwaidan is much better\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t- Part Three - Hoichi the Earless was easily my favorite part. It starts off by us hearing the story of this battle, while seeing these awesome illustrations of the story\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t- The main character is a blind musician, and he is so skilled at singing about the story of the battle while playing his Japanese styled guitar, that the ghosts who fought in the battle ask him to join them in the spirit world to perform\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t- Eventually, his friends figure out what he has been doing and take him away during a performance. In order to hide him from the spirits, they write tategaki all over his body, like you see on the Letterboxd poster\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t- But they do not cover his ears, which causes a ghost samurai to brutally chop them off\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t- Part Four - In a Cup of Tea is also great. It tells the story of a guard who becomes haunted by a ghost samurai whose image appears in his teacup\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t- Later the spirit approaches him and he slashes at it. The spirit's men then show up the following night and say their master will comeback for his revenge\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t- The guard then tries to attack the spirits and thinks he has defeated them, until they reappear. At this point he goes insane as this final story ends\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t- The style of this last battle was creative with how the excellent music sounded disjointed, along with these freeze frames of his opponents seemingly being defeated\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t- Kwaidan ends on a meta note as these characters who are apparently picking the order of these stories, note that it would not be possible to end in a satisfying way. Thankfully that is not the case since it does end on a chilling moment that I saw coming, but it still managed to get me\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\"I'll just leave it to you to imagine for yourself the best ending to a story about a man who swallowed another's soul.\"\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tI look forward to watching the second half of Kwaidan again someday, but I would be reluctant to ever watch that first half again. Can you think of any movies you only partly enjoy, and would be willing to skip sections of on repeated viewings.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tThanks for reading.\r\n\t\tHappy movie watching ... Skål! 🍻"

Masaki Kobayashi's film is high on style - pretty much every frame of this film could be framed and hung on a wall it is so beautiful. The production values are amazing and the use of colours - particularly reds and blues - is whimsical and otherworldly. The stories are a mixed bag and clearly the film is more tuned to awe rather than actual shocks. The first story is rather simplistic and the weakest of the bunch. The second one is the crowd pleaser - it focuses on a woman who saves a man from the snow on the condition that he never tells anyone about her. Anyone who has seen Tales From the Darkside the Movie will recognise it, but here it is much beautifully presented. The third tale is obviously the centrepiece and features the most majestic set pieces. It is rather drawn out, but effective for what it is. I wonder how far Kwaidan's influence goes - it reminded me a lot of Eyes Wide Shut. The fourth and final story is the shortest and appears to be here for comic relief more than anything else. Kwaidan is a film you can really get lost in and certainly it's easy to do that with the three hour runtime. So much time has been spent on creating the atmosphere - the visions, colours, smoke etc are all so mesmerising and justify the long runtime, even if the quality varies between tales."

Because it was a major blind-spot for me, and I'm happy to say that it lived up to its expectations, and of course, so much more. Director Masaki Kobayashi, who about scarred me for life with the sinister Kwaidan, finds a elegant stasis between honor and illusion, and the atmosphere floats in the air - existing in a void of space. Just on the surface, it's quite haunting, but it digs deeper in the meticulous structure of the dramatic tension, as well as what the structure reveals about the characters and when. In capturing the stripping of history and legacy, Harakiri offers a transitory evocation of human experience. It feels fleeting, here one moment and gone the next, and the only reason why I'm not rating it higher is because I don't believe I have the capacity to fully embrace it just yet. It begs for repeat viewings to not just follow the landscape of the narrative, but to observe how the film physically takes shape in blocking and setting. What a riveting experience, and such a grand accomplishment in storytelling and formal language."

I'm talking about those foreign, black and white movies that are whispered about only in the halls of letterboxd. Why do I put off watching them for months, and finally force myself to watch them only through the guise of a challenge? Was Rashomon not enough? Did the magnificence of Citizen Kane not convince me that hyperbole has no sway when a masterpiece is on screen? Did I not finally sit down, ready to \"endure\" Tokyo Story, only to slap my forehead and groan, \"Never again, you idiot.\"\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tWell, here I was, yet again. Me, the fucking idiot. Kobayashi, about to blow my socks off.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tHarakiri may well be one of the most perfectly told stories I've ever seen. It's so meticulously plotted, so rich in detail, so profound in simplicity, so beautiful in technique.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tBut you know what's best of all? This film is fucking exhilarating! It's not Tokyo Story, which I absolutely love but can totally understand why someone would be bored to death. This is a movie I started watching lying on my bed, and ended on my feet, my hands outstretched like a mad pantomime woman, muscles tensed and eyes watering from not daring to blink and miss a millisecond of Kobayashi's glorious masterpiece."

Many thanks to Letterboxd member Sam Redfern for providing the YouTube link. I don't know how long it might have taken me to get around to seeing this masterpiece otherwise.\r\n\r\n\t\tThe title, of course, refers to the Japanese practice of \"ritual suicide by disembowelment.\" It came about as part of bushido, the honor code of the samurai warrior class. By the 17th century, peace had come to Japan and warriors were no longer needed. Thousands of them became masterless ronin as the samurai system collapsed. This story describes the tale of one such ronin, who comes to the residence of a local lord to ask permission to commit harakiri in the estate's courtyard.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tThere's a story within the story, a bit of mystery and some wonderful swordplay in the course of the film. One scene is particularly impressive - a duel fought beyond a graveyard on a windswept hillock that beats any Western showdown I've ever seen. Some might complain that the pacing is slow, but I found it to be absolutely perfect. Pregnant pauses and lingering shots create an atmosphere far better than any score could. Silence builds tension and adds to the suspense.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tThe final reckoning is a bit over-choreographed, and there are some lighting errors regarding shadows if one wants to pick nits. On the whole, however, this is yet another testament to the greatness of Japanese film-making as well as the universality of themes like duty, honor, compassion and resolve. When folks say, \"They don't make movies like they used to,\" this is the \"used to\" they are referring to."

It appears to do so with very little effort however beneath the surface it tells a whole different story for the duck is paddling fast and furiously, as if its very life depended upon it. In many cases it does! This speaks volumes about this film! On the surface it appears to be a simple straightforward story when in fact it's magnificently complex once the layers are masterfully peeled away layer by layer painfully exposing the raw nerves that lie just below the surface!\r\n\r\n\t\tThe film deals heavily in appearances, namely issue regarding honor or lack thereof. The film in my opinion seems to invite you to contemplate various ideals, traditions, situations to decipher whether or not living simply for the sake of honor at any cost including integrity is truly an honorable virtue or is sacrificing your honor for the sake of others more honorable.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tThis is not your typical Samurai film, it is more cerebral, philosophical in nature. That being said dear Samurai fans never fear there will be blood and sword fights as well it is however not its main focus! It is also a tragic tale of love and inevitably revenge. The destination in this case takes a backseat to the complex, layered, journey that unfolds unhurriedly with a greater sense of purpose!\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tOther films featuring Harakiri aka Seppuku (ritual disembowelment) pale in comparison for the vindictive cruel nature of the hosts of said Harakiri were as despicable as they were dishonorable! Even for me.. a seasoned gorehound it was an extremely difficult watch! Not that it was that graphic in nature, no for me it was a psychologically torturous affair which to me is far far worse!\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tIt is a remarkable piece of Samurai cinema that I highly recommend! Enjoy :-)"

I was already gawking by the time Harakiri unequivocally set the human aspect against the seemingly unshakable Japanese traditions & glory and sang its eternal tale of love for family and to what lengths people go to save their loved ones, but I still wasn't prepared for the hard-hitting ending. Japanese honor just got trampled beneath the crippling power of universal love that cannot be associated with just one nation but which rules over all country-specific customs and, yes, even over the apparently stainless Japanese renown that got obliterated in the most human & most fitting way by none other than a Japanese film (made in 1962!). Because 'after all, this thing we call samurai honor is ultimately nothing but a facade.' God, I'm speechless."

Hitchcock's suggestion of nudity on film and frank depiction of sex outside of wedlock created horniness for the first time in our history. Hitchcock got everyone sprung before immediately showing the most brutal murder that had ever been depicted in art. The juxtaposition of these two heretofore never experienced phenomena created something called \"psychology\" for the first time ever and permanently warped Americans' minds by connecting having a mother to sex and death. Truly Hitchcock is the master of puppets."

However, this is the one that speaks to me the most strongly, the most personally. It reminds me of my father, who passed away only a short two years ago. It reminds me of my home, which I love and miss so dearly. It reminds me of my past, my childhood. There is so much going on in Nostalghia, so much to take in, that to some, it may come off as perplexing.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tTo those people I say, \"I understand,\" because indeed it is a very complicated, even mystifying film. Therefore, instead of going on and on about how much I love the film, I am going to provide a number of brief theories as to what I believe this film is about.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tKeep in mind that this is only one man's word, and as Tarkovsky would say, \"poetry is untranslatable, like the whole of art.\"\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tThings to keep in mind while watching Nostalghia...\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t- Materialism has had a strong influence on modern society, and it's important to separate yourself from this influence as much as possible, in order to stay in touch with your true self.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t- People are constantly transforming in ways both good and bad; one of the most miraculous transformations that a human being can experience (or even observe) is that from daughter to mother.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t- There is no need for our world to be so divided, so broken up. We must come together as one and be kind to all souls who dwell on this Earth.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t- It can be very difficult to leave your home, and your family, but the world is a gorgeous place - a place worth exploring.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t- There is great beauty, even in darkness.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t- Stay faithful to those you love; resist temptation.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t- Love even those who (attempt to) betray you.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t- The creation of life is a miracle worthy of pondering, worthy of deeply appreciating.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t- Human beings can learn great things from their memories. One should not stray away from these thoughts, but rather, use these thoughts to better themselves.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t- People can be cruel; they always have been. That will most likely never change.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t- Bring light into the world. It is your responsibility.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t- Learn to accept the person you have been, the person you are, and the person you are becoming, or you will be met with great melancholy.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t- While the world is beginning to end, it is not yet beyond repair.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t- A child's innocence is not only precious, but divine.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t- There are many paths that one can take through life, and it is up to each living spirit to decide which path is best for them to take.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t- Death is not the end of life.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tThis is one of the few films that I can safely say has made me a warmer and more caring person. To those of you who haven't seen Nostalghia, it comes highly recommended from me; to those of you who have seen it but remain unsure about the film, trust me, it gets better with each and every viewing.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tI'll leave it at that for now. Remember:\r\n\t\t\"One drop plus one drop makes a bigger drop, not two.\"\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t"

		"ReviewText": "[deep breath] There are people who believe the idea of Godard making an unsuccessful film is purely hypothetical, and they get very upset with intellectually-underperforming philistines who aren't with the program, a level of dedication with a certain level of faith-investment I find hard to muster. That commitment goes for Tarkovsky too, but (ulp) I'm an agnostic. So look: Nostalghia is gorgeous, in non-maximalist ways that have to do with slivers of light and shade reflected on the tiniest of surfaces. (I could see a film like this serving as the basis for e.g. the entire Lisandro Alonso project thus far.) Tarkovsky understands that the compositional differences that ensue when moving a camera even six inches can be enormous, and close attention is required to keep up. No problem!\r\n\r\n\t\tAnd yet: here's a filmmaker who said, no joke intended, \"I can't stand mirth. Cheerful people seem guilty to me, because they can't comprehend the mournful value of existence. I accept happiness only in children and the elderly, with all others I am intolerant.\" This isn't even that far off from my worldview, but I find it hard to take when it's so clearly and strongly expressed, without anything to dispel the one-directional gloom aside from a friendly canine (dogs get a pass too, apparently). For Tarkovsky, faith and spirituality is a constant quest most clearly expressed in a slow trudge through an obstacle course of his own devising, one in which the most minute journey distance-wise is an arduous trek, in which every step has as much potential difficulty and degree of difference for the person moving as for the camera. Here, his chosen sites of contemplation are interiors that are very much Zone II, to the point of self-parody — water dripping down from the ceiling onto a tiled floor exactly here, a rusty object placed meticulously right there, all calibrated for certain depth-of-frame effects — to the point where this is closer to an installation than a film. The result seems (to me, of little faith) a melding of the worst of The Mirror (more of father Arseniy's poetry and more overt autobiography, the filmmaker-in-exile represented rather bluntly) without that film's giddy speed and Stalker."

Words! Words! At last I know what Hamlet meant. He was fed up with windbags. And so am I! Why do I talk this way?

		"ReviewText": "Like John Huston's The Dead, Tarkovsky's final film addresses regret. Having spent his days crafting ideas, speaking his mind, and ultimately sacrificing his life for art, Tarkovsky bows out with a film that, among other things, demands to know why no one takes action. At the same time, it feels like an apologia of his leaving behind his family and pursuing his filmmaking in Italy and Sweden, and it is an expression of deep, profound faith. It staggers me to see so much put into a film, so ably made.\r\n\r\n\t\tWhat stands out is the use of mirrors. Tarkovsky at this point seemed to be devoted to the long take, the sacred tool of filmmakers seeking to maintain continuity, suspension of disbelief, and the fluidity of perspective that is how we experience the world. To do this, on multiple occasions, he positions mirrors just so, calling attention to them via movement (either in the reflection or of the mirror itself) and lets them show what is happened off camera, so that the take will remain unbroken. He reminds us of what is beyond our perception without reminding us that we are limited to the range of the camera, and instead of remember this is a movie, we simply become enriched by the knowledge of how deep this setting goes.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tThe religious nature of this film is slightly ambiguous--is it God or the witch? It doesn't matter. What matters is that there is a spiritual truth in this setting, that miracles occur. The stunning climax of spiritual power is one of the most startling moments--save perhaps the end of Stalker, an equally supernatural moment--in Tarkovsky's work. In one read, it is a definitive statement, a declaration of absolute spirituality. (The other read I will come to later.) What follows is a depiction of horrifying dignity--a man fulfilling his promise to God in a manner akin to Abraham readying his knife over his son in terms of dramatic impact. It is the titular sacrifice, and it depicts a spirituality that suggests that faith is a duty, an active characteristic. Faith is not necessarily a contract, but we must attend our responsibilities to God.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tThe idea that there is anything worth sacrificing everything one loves is striking from a man whose latter life was spent away from his home. The film takes pains to show appreciation for art, over and over again, whether in music, paintings, or other things beautiful--trees, maps, and so on. It delves deeply into matters of philosophy, and it draws attention to a world full of romantic coincidence in the form of the story of the photographs. This passing suggestion is that there is a deeper meaning to life, that the worst of times can build to moments of profundity much later. It is as if to say, \"My departure was not in vain.\"\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tAnd that comes back to regret. There is a shred of doubt here, in the form of the demand for action. As a man who spent his life in the realm of expression, is this film, about apocalypse and an implied nuclear war, a tacit acknowledgement that perhaps there was more he could have done? That there might have been more than simply filmmaking to be done to actively combat the restrictions on his art? This is wild speculation.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tThe other interpretation I referenced above is that what Alexander experiences is madness rather than supernatural, that the appearance of the ambulance at the end (so sudden as it was) is explained by the fact that his madness was known to his loved ones. Torn by a love triangle between himself, the maid, and his wife, he has gone mad and sought to destroy the potent symbol of his marriage--the house he and his wife discovered together--and gone mad. The visions of apocalypse and the whole birthday experience were all in his head, and the ending is his being taken away to a psychiatric institute. Under this interpretation, the film is more about the conflict between his love of his family and his love of his art, and the destruction being his exile. It is more direct, but no less powerful.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tWhat makes Tarkovsky one of my favorite directors is how his films contain all of this at once. He is capable of capturing incredible emotion and profound thought all at once, and to turn those into stunning visuals. His ideas rest alongside one another rather than lined up sequentially. He expressed them visually and audibly, but when he resorts to dialogue, it isn't generally didactic or expository, but narrative and, if not necessarily natural, certainly poetic. It is always a viewing experience that hits me right in the heart, and I can't express how satisfying it is."

		"ReviewText": "My entry into the films of Andrei Tarkovsky is his final effort, The Sacrifice, completed just months before his death in 1986. I know very little of the director, but if I were to try to sketch him given only The Sacrifice as a guide, I would have to imagine he was a man with deep spiritual conviction. The film centers around a senescent philosopher, Alexander (Erland Josephson), who learns that a nuclear war is imminent at his birthday celebration and the action he takes to prevent its occurrence.\r\n\r\n\t\tThe painterly compositions and pristine mise en scène exhibit that Alexander’s world is ordered and polished—despite his connection with nature he’s still a victim of worldly desires, thus having a spiritual connection with the land and material possessions, especially as they complement one another; he talks about being in love with his house and the edifice’s almost supernatural ability to make everything right if only he could own it, even going so far as to call the sale of it being “a miracle”, but he also plants a tree with his young son and shares with him a legend of a monk’s dedication to nurturing life via watering a similarly dying sapling and how he encouraged new life through perseverance. Alexander obviously has a spiritual connection to the world, but when asked by his friend Otto, Alex admits that his relation to God is nonexistent. There’s a dichotomy with his philosophical leanings toward the rational and his connections to his lived experience meditating heavily on the spiritual (though not specifically on religion). He lectures on the prevalence of sin—“sin is that which is unnecessary; and if so, our entire civilization is built on sin, from beginning to end.”—without admitting to the existence of a god. \r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tSo when the news of a nuclear Apocalypse upends Alexander’s psyche, it’s curious that his first reaction is to genuflect and begin to pray. He fumbles through a few lines of the Lord’s Prayer before appealing to God for clemency outright—offering to sacrifice his home, his family, and ultimately what he values most, his son, to be spared the fear and devastation of the war. It’s an exploration of the possibility, as Tarkovsky claimed, “that one can resume life by restoring the union with oneself and by discovering a spiritual source.”\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tBut the religious and occult commingle in The Sacrifice—Alexander is seduced by the promise of mercy if he will bed a local witch, urged on by his soothsayer-esque postman who recreationally deals in the paranormal. When Alexander wakes the morning after completing the task under the ghostly cloak of night, he sets about performing the mass sacrifice of divesting himself of everything he originally had a spiritual connection with—his house, his family, even the woods of his home as he is carted away by mysterious medical orderlies to be isolated in a hospital. \r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tThere is certainly a dreamlike quality to this film. The occurrences in the second act taking place under the shroud of dimness, interstitially between illusory images of Alex’s stepdaughter, with the following day having none of the ominous, terror-stricken tenor as the day before, leaves questions as to whether the entire sequence took place in a dream-state or if in fact a spiritual phenomenon occurred. The ambiguity here can result in many divergent readings, and the longer I ponder it, many intricate possibilities present themselves as candidates, each as valid and individual as the human experience and its relation to the inexplicable, the metaphysical, and the spiritual."

No, there's the fear of death, and that is an awful fear.\"\r\n\r\n\t\tAdd to the list of things I never thought I'd see a spiritual allegory about nuclear holocaust by Andrei Tarkovsky whose denouement features a hilarious slapstick chase sequence, but that's just what his final film The Sacrifice is. The occasion for the film is the birthday gathering to honor Alexander (Ingmar Bergman regular Erland Josephson), a former actor and distinguished journalist now entering his twilight years. Alexander is mired in a difficult marriage; his younger English wife Adelaide (Susan Fleetwood) is resentful of having to give up the stage in order to live remotely and consoles herself through an affair with the handsome but misanthropic doctor Victor (Sven Wollter). Alexander's recourse now comes through other kinds of love (e.g., parental love for his child son Little Man, organic love for unbridled nature, narcissistic love of his own voice).\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tPrior to his fete Alexander takes a long walk with Little Man (who has been rendered temporarily mute by a throat operation) and protests at great length to the uncomprehending boy regarding the foul ways in which scientific advances are routinely perverted in the name of violence. Hours later a grim radio broadcast indicates the onset of a catastrophic nuclear war, and all hope seems futile until the heretofore atheistic Alexander makes an eleventh-hour deal with the man upstairs, which will entail the film's titular sacrifice.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tAs a key progenitor of slow cinema it's fair to say that Tarkovsky's pacing has never been rapid, but for much of The Sacrifice the Russian master further adjusted his settings from sedate to glacial. In particular much of the middle section (which is also shot in near total darkness) can drag, mired as it is in unleavened, deadly seriousness. Elsewhere, however, the film is uncommonly light by Tarkovsky's standards; there are funny little touches throughout (e.g., a postman obsessed with Nietzsche's notion of eternal return, Alexander's skateboarding shoes) and strangely broad comic set pieces in the final third that really enliven a film that can feel more than a little moribund at times.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tThe set design and cinematography (from Anna Asp and Sven Nykvist, more Bergman regulars) are thoroughly immaculate, but the six-minute single-take sequence involving a blazing edifice which nearly closes the film is a minor miracle unto itself (and had to be done a second time when the camera jammed!).\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tAdditional points for Susan Fleetwood's amazing mid-film hysterics.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tSome stray notes:\r\n\t\t-WATER THE TREE EACH DAY UNTIL IT COMES TO LIFE\r\n\t\t-MIGHTY RICHARD GREETS GOOD PRINCE MYSHKIN\r\n\t\t-YOUR LOYAL AND RICHARDIANS AND IDIOTISTS\r\n\t\t-BUT YOU'RE SO GLOOMY!\r\n\t\t-THAT NOTORIOUS DWARF\r\n\t\t-AND EVERYTHING BEGINS AGAIN FROM SCRATCH\r\n\t\t-MUTE AS A FISH\r\n\t\t-SOCIABILITY IS A BURDEN\r\n\t\t-WE USE THE MICROSCOPE LIKE A CUDGEL!\r\n\t\t-OUR CULTURE IS DEFECTIVE\r\n\t\t-AT LAST I KNOW WHAT HAMLET MEANT\r\n\t\t-AS IT HAPPENS \"THEATRE\" ISN'T EVERYTHING\r\n\t\t-I COLLECT INCIDENTS\r\n\t\t-IT WAS ONLY AN EVIL ANGEL PASSING BY, WHO SAW FIT TO TOUCH ME\r\n\t\t-IF YOU HAVE TO TORTURE SOMEONE\r\n\t\t-LIE WITH MARIA!\r\n\t\t-BUT THAT'S MADNESS, OTTO\r\n\t\t-ALL THAT EVIDENCE OF VIOLENCE!\r\n\t\t-NOTHING WILL HAPPEN TO YOU HERE\r\n\t\t-TIRED OF BEING YOUR NURSEMAID\r\n\t\t-ALEXANDER'S COMICAL YIN-YANG BATHROBE\r\n\t\t-SAY NOTHING!

If anything, I would probably lose my friends if I showed them this. Andrei Tarkovsky's final masterpiece, The Sacrifice is a haunting anti-war film that makes a deep and lasting impression on its viewers.\r\n\r\n\t\tTarkovsky's extensive use of long shots, and varying saturations of color (ringing of his earlier mysterious masterwork The Mirror) beautifully depict a ravaged apocalyptic Swedish landscape and one man's wish to have it all return to normal. As he delves further into his insane delusion, we can see how it affects his family as they too begin to lose all hope. The televisions stop broadcasting, the air gets mustier, the world continues to fall apart. This is the sci-fi post apocalyptic film for the art house crowd, and one of the most gorgeous and haunting anti-war films I have ever seen.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tIt seems all too appropriate that this would be Tarkovsky's final film. It is so powerful in its deliverance, so thoughtful in its presentation, so gorgeous in its atmosphere, I could not think of a more astounding and appropriate finale to the life of an auteur such as Tarkovsky. The monologues and interior discussions that occupy the majority of the film's runtime help present the director's own thoughts and opinions onto the screen, without making the characters seem too distant. It's a stroke of genius, and an overwhelming farewell from someone as brilliant as he was.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tThe Sacrifice managed to reach beyond the screen and touch my soul. The haunting story, combined with breathtaking cinematography and set pieces, bring Tarkovsky's brutal apocalyptic vision to life. Each of the actors are astounding, and feel like they each bear a vital piece of the story. This is not a film that you will enjoy. It is a darkly haunting piece of cinema that is a once in a lifetime experience. I've never in my twenty years seen a film anything like this, and I don't believe I ever will again. It's a massive piece of film to take in, and yet a gorgeous piece of art to absorb. It's one of Tarkovsky's best films, and one of the most beautiful films I've ever seen, period."

The deaths you witnessed? The philosophies you learned? This film is saying these are all correct, focusing on the idea that life is based off memory. Which then poses the question, is life only based off memory? Is what you didn't remember not considered a part of your life? Told with a visual style that had me literally pausing the film to take it all in, Mirror introduced me to a life so distant from my own but through a lens that felt so familiar. It's silly to think I or anyone is going to figure out the purpose and meaning behind life, but if there's anyone that'll make you feel like you're a little bit closer to figuring it out, it's Andrei Tarkovsky."

As a child I didn't understand, as an adult I don't have the humility to admit my many emotional failings. With dad being how he is, and me being me, I wonder if you ever heard it enough. But know this now, I love you. You are the reason for my every success.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tAs a child I didn't like to hug you. I didn't like contact, I didn't like closeness. Family to me always seemed arbitrary. But having you as my mother meant so much to me. Every single time I had an epileptic seizure, you found me and stayed with me all night. When I was at my lowest points, my most suicidal, you talked me into the help I needed. You've helped me through everything. On the day I arrived at university, before you drove home, I hugged you for the first time in years. It felt like the least I could do. You were the reason I'd got there and I was too selfish to appear grateful before.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tOne of my favourite films is called Mirror. It trawls through the memories of a dying man, you'd hate it. I'm sure to you it's another part of my weird taste in movies. Anyway, the final five minutes of Mirror are possibly the greatest in all cinema. A woman is asked a question: \"would you rather have a boy or a girl?\" The film doesn't show us her answer. I think of this scene often, of what mothers must desire for their children. You weren't married when I was born, and I wonder, what did you want me to become? For a long time, I felt like I failed you. I have no doubt that if we had lived through war or dire poverty, you'd have still raised me right. But did I grow up to become what you imagined? A neurotic movie nerd with trouble socialising. Am I worthy of you? I don't know, but all I know is that I have to try to make something of myself. I have to make you proud.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tWhen I look through my pile of memories, I have so many that I treasure. I remember when you studied for a degree whilst also raising two teenagers. I was so proud to see you graduate. I remember all the places you took us, all the times I misbehaved, all the ways you protected us. It's all so valuable to me. Whatever happens, I plead to God I never lose those memories.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tDad left a photo album downstairs last week. Inside was pictures of when I was 3 and 4, in our old house in Harehills. I forgot how small it was. But in every single picture I noticed something: I was smiling. Childhood is filled with little crises, but you got me through all of them. I can never thank you enough.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tLove,\r\n\t\tDarren"

They say it closely resembles death.\r\n\r\n\t\tAs much as I hate to be \"that guy\" that just immediately gives Solaris a perfect score after my first viewing; the raw, stripped down power of this cinematic creation simply must not go without the fullest extent of praise.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tDespite giving me one of the most unique experiences of my life, I think Solaris has yet to reveal all its secrets to me. And perhaps it never will. In that respect I think its a gift that keeps on giving. Like the ever changing, shifting, bubbling and churning surface of the fictional planet that gives the film its name, I think Solaris will take on a unique form every time its viewed. A piece of art that takes on a sentient form and pulls people's own subconscious thoughts, dreams and feelings into the mix almost seems to be an impossible feat. And many directors who try their whole careers to accomplish something even remotely close to this would tell you its a difficult task for sure.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tBut something tells me that an incredibly gentile, humble, and intelligent man like Tarkovsky probably pulled it off without even producing a single bead of sweat.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tSolaris tells the story of a psychologist with a broken past being sent to a space station hovering a planet of the same name. The incoming transmissions recently have become nonsensical and everyone who visits the foggy atmosphere above Solaris comes back rambling and describing delusions of grandeur. This is all setup via a lengthy, and ominous opening that lasts roughly 45 minutes. This time is spent learning of Solaris, the station, the missions, and watching visual testimonies of people to return from the ill fated ship. Its rather oppressive but amazingly builds up and establishes Solaris as being a place that will entirely blow you away, and take you to somewhere you've never been before. There is some bizarre and rather ominous foreshadowing and many scenes are held for very long takes; as if kissing the earth before being launched into the coldness of space.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tOnce you get there, something about the station just seems off. There are even some moments of genuine suspense and fear when the psychologist first arrives on the station. No one answers his shouts of hello, there is waste strewn about, and there is an eerie, deafening silence. Then you find the two remaining crew members. They are just in their rooms minding their own business. They don't pay any attention to the psychologist. One even tells him to come back in an hour. (Where the hell is he going to go?) They treat him like they either don't care about him, or like he's always been there on the ship....\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tIts here that Solaris really takes a turn for the cerebral. A projection of the psychologist (Kris) dead wife begins to materialize in the middle of the night and walks around the ship acting like she still exists. Much to Kris' horror at first, the image of his wife is explained by the surviving crew members as a creation of the planet Solaris itself. But soon he uses the inhuman image of his wife to say things to her he never got to say in person. He becomes attached to the projection. Solaris then turns into an examination of love, life, relationships and human nature itself. And what I probably most appreciated about Solaris was Tarkovskys amazing balance between images and dialogue to get his point across. You would think that a film like this relies heavily on strong visuals and many moments of long drawn out silence. But Solaris, like Tarkovskys other metaphysical mind bender Stalker, is very much a conversational film. The imagery is still strong as hell and some moments made me just stare at the screen for long periods of time in a trance. When you compare Soviet and American films from the same time period, there is an obvious difference in quality and resources available; but Solaris still supports its high concept modestly. The sets are awesome, the images subliminally intriguing and the score minimal but effective. Its both a large and small film. It tackles the smallest human issues that have the largest area of ambiguity.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tThe fact that something this bold works is a miracle beyond the realm of explainable science.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tSo what is Solaris? What is happening to the people on the station? Tarkovsky shows us but doesn't tell us why. The station is a cluster of winding halls and spacy rooms with specific functions. There's wiring, panels, books containing knowledge and circular windows looking to the outside. Nightmares and dreams literally taking on a new sheen. A few souls populate the halls; Kris being the everyman and Hari his wife embodying love. The two other crew members and their philosophical ramblings become almost moral or intellectual representatives. This makes the station almost take on the form of the human mind; and everything that happens inside its walls is only a meditation on the very nature of our personal existence. Science fiction is usually about outside discovery, but Solaris turns this on its head. Why do we turn to exploration when we hardly know anything about ourselves?\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tWe turn to the stars but ignore the vast ocean that lies between each one of our eyes. Solaris is truly an eye opening psychological experience that almost transcends film itself.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tIts a cinematic Rorschach test.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\"What do you see?\""

They are elusive things: the moment we name them, their meaning disappears, melts, dissolves like a jellyfish in the sun.\"\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tAs with the rest of Tarkovsky's masterpieces, there isn't much of a point in trying to write a review for Stalker. Any attempt to put your thoughts on this film into words will remove something special, something personal from its vision in your mind. Stalker will hold a different meaning to each and every person, so when it comes to how you feel about this film, there is truly no need to explain yourself. It would be like trying to explain something deeply experiential to a person who was not there to share that experience with you - they would have no way of understanding. Keep this film close to your heart... keep it inside you and protect it, for it is, quite simply, one of the greatest films ever made. And that's all that needs to be said about Stalker, because the rest will come naturally to those who watch it."

And, uh, yeah, hot take here, the rumors are true people, he’s good...\r\n\r\n\t\tThe film’s only 45 minutes or so but what it accomplishes in that time clearly already shows the beginnings of one of the all time acclaimed filmmakers. Even for a short student film, the cinematography is breathtaking. It creates an almost otherworldly atmosphere from the streets and tight alleyways of Moscow. Reflection shots are common: from shattered glass distorting perception to a puddle on the ground beaming the sun right at the camera.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tI couldn’t help but think about how these reflections were symbolic for how the young violin player, Sasha, and the steamroller, Sergei, saw each other. Sasha grew up an artist; he has a strict routine of violin practice and studies. On the contrary, Sergei was about his age when he went off to war, and now has to work as a steamroller to make ends meet. Sasha is equally fascinated with the hard labor Sergei conducts as Sergei is with Sasha’s music: you always want what you can’t have. I’m really looking forward to making my way through Tarkovsky’s films now. \r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t{#547 on Favorites list} {#2 on Best Movies of 1961 list}"

Despite being a student film, Tarkovsky's vision is clear, even if the film is little like his later works. Within The Steamroller and the Violin, Tarkovsky find beauty in music, in puddles, in conversation. He even manages to find beauty in dilapidated buildings being demolished. During the final act, the two leads cannot meet up and this simple trivial inaction feels like a tragedy. For all its slight nature and simple storytelling, The Steamroller and the Violin is ultimately very moving and hence worth commending. It seems that from the earliest days, Andrei Tarkovsky possessed cinematic skills so few ever had.\r\n\r\n\t\tSide note: The young musician is criticised by his teacher for not adhering to form and order despite playing beautifully. This adherence to beauty and creativity, not convention, is one of the things that sets Tarkovsky apart from most directors. In hindsight, it's a fascinating parallel."

		"ReviewText": "Watching a Hitchcock film is rather like going to a play: you're constantly reminded that everything is just pretend. Even if the experience is great, it never quite makes you realize that the same things can happen to you, that people like these can plausibly exist in real life. But Vertigo feels startlingly true, almost confessional, because it's clear that it's Hitchcock's most personal film, the one that came closest to revealing his inner turmoil.\r\n\r\n\t\tVertigo has a plot so convoluted that it's fully apparent that it's a mere set-up to get to the heart of the film: a chronicle of the protagonist Scottie's obsession. The film is also considerably sympathetic toward the two slighted women in Scottie's life: his friend Midge, and Judy, the woman he tries to mold into Madeline, the woman he has grown obsessed with.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tMidge is bespectacled, bright, and funny. She's very much in love with Scottie, and has been for years, but he's indifferent to her. She reminds me inexorably of Hitchcock's own wife, Alma Reville, who often wore those large glasses and who was a highly intelligent woman, instrumental to Hitchcock's career, but who was often ignored by Hitchcock in favor of his films and blondes.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tThe blonde, then, is Hitchcock's dream woman: cold, indifferent, and vaguely terrifying in a schoolmarm way. It's impossible to understand what Scottie sees in Madeline, who seems like a pale, flat ghost compared to the other two women in Scottie's life, but it is this otherworldly woman that Scottie desires. Madeline is always viewed through Scottie's gaze: she is simply an object of desire, an embodiment of all his fantasies.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tWhen Scottie loses her, he recedes into melancholia, and is only shaken out of it when he sees a woman who looks uncannily like Madeline. Judy is a lively brunette with the same features as Madeline, but with none of her coldness. Scottie does not love her for who she is, and forcibly begins to turn her into Madeline. He cannot understand that Madeline and Judy are the same woman, because he is unable to look past surfaces.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tAnd here is where Hitchcock's relationship with cinema comes into play. Judy's transformation is eerily similar to Hitchcock's own manipulation of his actresses. Scottie picks out Judy's outfits, tells her how to do her hair and makeup, and although he knows exactly what he wants, he never once spares a thought for Judy. \"It can't matter to you,\" he says, when she recoils upon realizing that he wants her to dye her hair blonde.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tJudy is looked upon with sympathy throughout the film. She is not an object of desire, and therefore she is allowed to show emotion. She loves Scottie, and all she wants is for him to love her back. \"If I change, will you love me?\" she asks him, when she realizes that he will never love her for who she is. It's a heartbreaking moment, one that any girl can identify with. It's also a brilliant demonstration of the changes that women, particularly actresses, go through in order to allow others to consider them desirable.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tScottie cannot love any of these women. He only loves an untouchable image, a fantasy that even Madeline would have been unable to fulfill. Scottie isn't the victim here; he is in fact something like a villain, someone who cannot understand the pain he is inflicting upon the people around him.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tScottie is Hitchcock, and Vertigo is a piece of Hitchcock's soul put up for endless scrutiny. It was a brave move, and one that revealed him to be a slightly better human being than Scottie, because his protagonist never realized the harm he caused women, while Hitchcock was fully aware of what he was doing, as the film illustrates. Of course he continued to ignore his wife and lust after a fantasy anyway. Vertigo never tries to present solutions. It simply illustrates a situation, and asks us to care."

		"ReviewText": "A masterclass in mystery & suspense, a marvel of technical filmmaking, and a perfect demonstration of how clueless & unprepared we are against the forces of nature, Alfred Hitchcock's The Birds remains one of the most under-appreciated works of his career and is easily amongst my top 3 favourites from this genius filmmaker.\r\n\r\n\t\tStarting on a relaxed note which only serves as the calm before the storm, The Birds concerns a wealthy San Francisco socialite who pursues her romantic interest to his small Northern California town where things soon take a turn for the bizarre when the entire community is suddenly & viciously attacked by birds of all kinds for no explicable reason.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tIngeniously directed by Alfred Hitchcock, the first half is pretty much a romantic plot that aptly introduces and fleshes out its characters but it also steadily builds up its foreshadowing events underneath which then take over the screen like an invading horde and completely changes the mood & atmosphere into a downright terrorising one in the next half.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tThe script is loosely based on the 1952 story of the same name and even though the dialogues don't carry much dramatic weight, the events are penned down brilliantly as almost every scene featuring the birds is a tense one. Camerawork is exquisitely carried out, editing never lets the boredom set in, and while it lacks a full-fledged score, the sound design make up for it and it's no less than a revelation for its era.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tThe film marks the screen debut for Tippi Hedren while also starring Rod Taylor, Suzanne Pleshette, Jessica Tandy & a young Veronica Cartwright. And although everyone hops along finely, the real highlight of the film is the manner in which Hitchcock truly builds up the suspense and handles the mystery element by keeping the entire plot quite unpredictable from start to finish.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tOn an overall scale, The Birds is arguably the final masterpiece to come out from Alfred Hitchcock canon and is one of the finest works in the genres of horror & mystery. It is a true testament to Hitchcock's reputation as 'The Undisputed Master of Suspense', for he effortlessly manages to transform the usually beautiful & innocent creatures into one of cinema's most terrifying villains.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tWorthy of all the praise it has garnered over the years, definitely in need of a broader audience and deserving of a spot among Hitchcock's finest films, The Birds is an intelligently directed, smartly scripted, aptly performed & precisely crafted cinema that was far ahead of its time, and not only does it promise & deliver a thrilling cinematic experience but with its ambiguous ending, it remains an unsolved mystery even today. Highly recommended."

I walked out of the cinema in a daze, baffled and thrilled and grinning like a damn fool. My car is a two door red Honda Civic and yet I approached a white SUV with my keys out as if it was my ticket home because my mind was racing, overwhelmed by spectacle, dazzled by ambition.\r\n\r\n\t\tThankfully the theater screening this tonight is literally a few blocks from my abode because honestly, I feel like I suffered a concussion and am unsure how to retrace my steps. All I can think about is Interstellar, the audacious achievement by Christopher Nolan, the finest work of his career.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tWhen the film concluded, half the theater erupted into applause and the other half sat there scratching their heads wondering if they even liked it at all. I was stuck in some sort of cinematic purgatory, knowing I loved it and wanting to stand and cheer and yet my ass stayed glued to the seat and I remained quiet and still. It wasn't because the film isn't worthy, it is. It is worthy of more admiration than the clapping of hands can demonstrate. I can't explain why, but in that moment I was incapable of being a functional human being.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tI just wanted to sit there and watch it again, dissect the science, try to understand the confounding final act. Luckily on November 15th I plan on going back again and try to put more coherent words together to explain why I know I will cherish a film like this for years to come.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tI adore science fiction because it is a way to travel to distant worlds, a way to explore the unimaginable, a way to forget about a bad work day or a pile of bills to pay and see the grand spectacle of what is possible beyond the walls that surround us. Interstellar delivered everything I could have hoped for and more."

Osaka Elegy presents a woman who becomes her boss's mistress. She is not valued as a person by the men in her life. Instead she is abandoned by them, as they are cowardly and do not wish to associate with her. Yet social forces and peer pressure surround us all, especially our need for money. Osaka Elegy is a film about women with little choice. They have to survive, and becoming a mistress pays for that. This is cinema of the unfortunate, about people who make reasonable decisions given their situation and yet are ostracised for it. Our lead shows strength and is ultimately punished for it, left alone, destitute, and rejected even by family.\r\n\r\n\t\tOsaka Elegy feels like a criticism of conservative values. Materialism creates shallow lives, and the pursuit of such shallowness gives pain to others. The sexlessness of the affairs shown here are also indicative of the conservative values of the time. Drawing on tradition, Osaka Elegy shows a bunraku puppet performance which reflects the narrative itself. Additionally traditional values leave sex workers suffering, yet the modernity of the world creates people who want pleasure at any price. Through these ideas, one could certainly note feminist and marxist aspects to Osaka Elegy, regardless of authorial intent. Ultimately Osaka Elegy is one of the modern world, filled with shots that create a city which is electric and rain-splattered. Yet what Mizoguchi finds beneath everything is a world of suffering women."

Mizoguchi ranks alongside Ozu and Kurosawa as one of the greats of Japanese cinema and directed around 70 films during his career.\r\n\r\n\t\tOsaka Trilogy is a morality tale about the perils of becoming a mistress which provided an interesting insight into pre-war Japanese society. The print I saw was fairly grainy and the presentation was fairly stagey and flat. I enjoyed it more as a historical document than a drama as you rarely got close in on the actors and none of the performers were particularly outstanding.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tSo far, I much prefer the post-war films from Yasujirō Ozu which built on the Mizoguchi style. You couldn’t get away with something so thinly written today, but the short run-time and historical perspective made this an interesting watch and I’m keen to see a few more from this period and this director."

Mizoguchi composes shots that emphasize depth and his camera weightlessly moves through spaces in long, unbroken takes that result in a suggestion of three-dimensionality that is far more visually interesting than what the best 3D movie can offer. Reminiscent of a Greek tragedy but reckless hubris is replaced with unwavering loyalty, and the resulting downfall is as honorable as it is tragic.\r\n\r\n\t\tI read only after watching this that it was commissioned by the Japanese military, and in fact, opened just one week before the attack on Pearl Harbor. I can certainly see it as a call to arms and plea for nationalistic loyalty and sacrifice in a time of uncertainty, but it's also so sad that I wonder if Mizoguchi didn't pull a fast one on the military by treating the \"revenge\" in the story with such ambivalence. Perhaps I missed a detail, but the incident that sets off the entire conflict remains somewhat ambiguous right up to the end. There are no rousing action scenes. The largest scale conflict happens off-screen and is described in a letter that is read out loud by a secondary character. Testament to how drawn into the story I was: There's a point midway through reading the letter that the character pauses, and it's far more suspenseful than I ever imagined such a scene could be."

Made as a morale booster during World War Two, it was meant to exemplify the loyalty, sacrifice, persistance, and honour people were expected to uphold in difficult times. This context does limit the film a little, and it is broader and more mainstream than Mizoguchi usually worked in. For sure it is less focused on class. Though there does exist one scene of debate about whether the ronin should prioritise their own honour or protecting the poor townsfolk and farmers. Mizoguchi also manages to get his examination of gender roles into the film, albeit it briefly and only towards the end.\r\n\r\n\t\tMizoguchi's approach to the popular story of the 47 ronin is calm and steady. The action is offscreen and it is mostly a film of dialogue, with a deliberate pace and a more cerebral tone than one may expect. It is a dry film with a lot of politicking. What Mizoguchi draws on is not the actions of individuals, but the complex social systems in 18th Century Japan and how they do not serve justice. Furthermore the film is about how rules within such a system can be bent with real determination and sacrifice. A man must ruin himself before he can convincingly take on the system. This more philosophical approach asks questions about culture, even though it is done under the guise of propaganda. It is meant to celebrate men who would die for their daimyo, but I feel Mizoguchi moves the emphasis to show men who would die not for their daimyo but because they are powerless in the face of the system and their sacrifice is noble proof of that. It's interesting that Japan of the 1940s saw itself as the heroic daimyo of The 47 Ronin and not the corrupt, merciless Tokugawa Shogunate that demands suicide from its citizens.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tThe 47 Ronin is not Mizoguchi's Seven Samurai. This is a solemn and serious work, that draws from real historical customs. However despite being a respectable work, it is very hard to get into and needlessly long. It might have the glimpses of depth that reveal something greater than crass propaganda, yet The 47 Ronin is still ultimately a thematic lightweight compared to Mizoguchi's earlier films which dealt with more detailed ideas around class and status. It does manage to be about sacrifice, which is very Mizoguchi, but it's not compelling enough to justify its length. The 47 Ronin is a unique retelling of a legendary event, and definitely interesting in many ways, but as a viewing experience it's a bit middling."

And oddly enough, (though perhaps because of this?) these last works rarely feel like than culmination's of years than they seem like formal advancements. Street of Shame - it's odd that the movie continues to be regarded by it's NA distrubution title, the direct translation 'Red Light District,' makes far more sense - is quicker, tougher, faster than previous Mizoguchi's, resembling more the direct representation of his mid-30's films than the Brechtian theatre of his 40's work or the Buddhist humanism of the other 50's films. Yet, it is far less satisfying on a narrative level than those earlier works - what's left is a series of vignettes, little episodes of daily life in the Dreamland 'Cafe,' a sort of 'fly-on-the-wall' melodrama where we don't know who to side with, who is telling the truth, who is planting ruses, etc. Then an hour later, the film will implode with extraordinary emotional power - in a sense we start at the end and move backwards, because we are dropped right into the action as the film opens and then we work our way back to contextualization. It leaves us with questions - what is 'civilized society,' and is it worth returning to? How does one re-enter the system that champions their abuse and exploitation? Everyone in this film is wrong in this film but the women who work the geisha house - the people who vote for the anti-prostitution bill yet refuse to treat these women with any respect, and the brothel owners who try to disuade the geisha from voting - though ironically they are the ones who keep them well treated and provide them with work (the reason the women are told for keeping them staying) - though the obvious becomes quite clear as the movie progresses - that they want them not to vote because then the owners lose a source of profits.\r\n\r\nMizoguchi finds the feudalism of his period pieces no different than the 20th century capitalism this film depicts - people are bought, sold, become investments, and nobody questions it. When people finally open their mouths to talk about their dreams and hopes it comes as a shock - an almost horrific irony because we can already sense its futility. And then the emotional outbursts of the end come as a shock - because they are still so powerful even though we were well aware of the inevitable from the beginning. A son rejects his mother when he discovers her profession, because here reputations are more important than flesh. There is an attempted murder, another woman loses her mind - interesting to note that this sequence, with it's flashing lights and shadows, is the only sequence to return to Mizoguchi's expressionist roots - in a way it's the inexorable outcome of this naturalist, literal presentation - in laymans terms the visual style mimics Yumeko's psychological collapse, because it is the world that is truly twisted and insane, and not her.\r\n\r\nIt's ultimately telling that nothing changes in the films outcome (dare I say anything about the most haunting final shot in Mizoguchi's cinema?) - because the movie itself is a simple portrait - again 'Red Light District,' makes more sense here than 'Street of Shame' - what I linger on as this movie sits with me are these windows into lives - small moments - such as the one where Hanae refuses to commit suicide, because she wants to live long enough to see the system she lives in collapse."

After his 1950s output saw a few thematic diversions and a much larger scale, it's quite apt for Mizoguchi's last work to be a more traditional setup. It's also one of his best films.\r\n\r\n\t\tStreet of Shame is about women who work in a brothel. It is at times aimless, filled with small dramas within this shared location. Yet it presents sex workers in an honest fashion, dealing with their struggles, their feelings, and their status. This is a film of debt and tears. This tough reality allows suicide to become an option. Money troubles dominate the film, as men become unemployed, women scrounge for work, and children are left undernourished. A question is asked about whether Japan can be a civilised country if a mother cannot even afford milk for her baby. Let's not lie to ourselves, we should all be asking that question about our own countries even now.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tStreet of Shame deals with prostitution in a very nuanced manner that prioritises the workers over the sometimes wealthy customers. The women here are afforded independence by having a job only they can fulfil, and yet they are constrained by economic circumstances. They have conflicting feelings about selling their bodies. It is needed for their economic survival, yet it is not considered honourable. Being related to a prostitute is enough to ruin somebody's life. The women in Street of Shame find themselves with few friends, as even family are ashamed of them. As sex workers they face discrimination and prejudice. The society Mizoguchi saw and thus depicted was despicable, providing women with few opportunities and then shaming them for what they do. It hurts their souls when men see them only as whores, placing value only upon their body. But Mizoguchi pushes further. Street of Shame presents a fictitious anti-prostitution bill which is set to change these lives forever. Yet Street of Shame becomes a direct indictment of politicians and their lies, weaknesses, and betrayals. Society has a lower strata that we like to ignore, and Mizoguchi's most noble trait is that he stood up for them throughout his career.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tStreet of Shame is Mizoguchi's most modern film, filled with Western music and clothes. It is a fitting end for a director who picked apart Japan's conservative society for decades and then questioned every step of change to ensure the world was not moving backwards. His films capture the political and social landscapes of Japan across many time periods. He was backward-looking and forward-thinking, showing the past and demanding we make the future better. Street of Shame presents different women each going through different life experiences. This new, modern, westernised Japan was flawed and had merely repackaged the pain of the past. So Mizoguchi's final piece is another reminder that we must never stop fighting to improve the world. Films that build beauty and sympathy with the lives of the poor will forever have my heart. Mizoguchi was the most understanding and caring of directors, and he both bettered cinema and the world itself."

Chronicling two couples' surreal experiences of survival and fortune-hunting during social unrest, Ugetsu is simply masterful in its stylish, patient presentation of intertwined character studies, even though almost all \"twists\" are visible from miles away, but it doesn't take away anything from the viewing experience, thanks to both Mizoguchi's commanding of the score, camera, and light, as well as outstanding performances from the foursome ensemble.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tDespite the rather unsubtle source material, Mizoguchi's created in his lens a timeless classic that ultimately feels much grander and more underhandedly feminist than its original text suggests, and a rather friendly and ravishing entry into his criminally underrated filmography.

The film leaves us almost nothing but a possibility to say: when she was born. Long takes make sure that Oharu goes through every humiliation and every desperation, that she handles every tiny emotion from small to something big.\r\n\r\n\t\tShe is beaten and torn apart - happiness doesn't quite balance the film because the brief experiences of it aren't enough to canopy the fatalism. This is a fate set by men, the extremely unequal system that still belongs to the everyday. Even today the equality situation between men and women there has been ranked somewhere among top 120 worst countries. But all this is only poor trivia compared to the soul that Mizoguchi brings to the film with his cold, elaborate mise-en-scene. It's very weird to say that someone could make a soulful film with something cold. But when this cold is truth that becomes sympathy because it is honesty, we can truly talk about a film with a soul.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tFilm's power comes from its images. Who could forget the humor-filled woman searching scene that actually is everything opposite and so accurately constructs the whole ridiculousness of woman's position - it's very sharp and clear picture of people who aren't humans, it's not the root of the problem but the problem itself. Or the image of Oharu sitting in front of men who reject her natural, human position, spit at her behind their high, artificial positions and their vanity. Perhaps the single most freezing scene is where Oharu tells the men who are chasing her: \"I gave him his life\". Men stop at once, bow before her. At that moment she is a saint. But soon this nearly religious experience wears off and they are back at poor Oharu's throat.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tMizoguchi's extreme approach isn't for everyone and it's not easy to understand or even accept but it is the truth. And we shouldn't just skip it as \"lesson of the past\". I don't think we have come too far from it. It's not \"Japanese problem\" nor just \"feminism\". It's universal problem, a film about being a human. Haunting and devastating - perhaps because the film never really ends.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t"

Oharu is the incarnation of many women; daughters despised by their fathers, women used by men, mothers separated from their children, courtesans and servants seen as mere objects, stigmatized prostitutes and ignored beggars. In addition to the themes often addressed by the filmmaker, and his tireless denouncement of women's oppression, there is the criticism of a hypocritical, false and classist society.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tA simple and profoundly human drama, elegantly filmed by Mizoguchi and with a superb performance by Kinuyo Tanaka; Saikaku Ichidai Onna is devastating, beautiful and deeply sad."

Even before the Code, even before the blacklist, we always had to hide it, to make it subtle, to hint at it without saying it. We became pretty good at it, and if you knew what you were looking for, you could find it. Men had wives and women had husbands, but the right tension here, the right gesture there, and the symbol of queerness was on the screen for us to relate to. We've always been on the edges, telling our stories without telling our stories; that's why the conventional narratives rarely seem to fit.\r\n\r\n\t\tThere's tension immediately between Guy and Bruno (there's nothing but tension in this film). The film famously opens on their paralleled walks, their shoes the only true distinguishing marks; these two men are both symbols, hobo-sign for the outsiders. Bruno's interest in Guy contains hints of everything both men represent: predator and prey, desperate and desperate, out and closeted, angry and sad. It's no coincidence that the targets of the swapped murders are a father (patriarchal domination) and a wife (heteronormativity). It's no coincidence that Miriam's promiscuity is contrasted with Anne's unspoken chastity. It's no coincidence that Guy and Bruno each contain stereotypical features of queerness that are cast in slightly different light in this film.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tOther stories are told at the same time. On the surface, it's easy to watch an enjoyable noir thriller about manipulation and murder. In the shadows, there is a tale about power and fear, about exposure and control, about fame and family. In the editing, there's only suspense, something so tightly wound that it vibrates, thrums, snaps at the slightest movement, and continually binds together the images we see. But the story that stands out to those of us on the outside is the story in the subtle cues, the one we're forced to hunt for in cryptological camera tricks and characterizations. As Guy rushes to be exonerated, he's not rushing to his liberation but his continued imprisonment, because there in his closet is safer than under the heel of hatred. Bruno isn't just his doppelganger; Bruno is his queerness trying to destroy him. It's not a homophobic screed; it's a twisted portrayal of how our witch-hunting destroys from within and without."

Right at the beginning of his best decade, it kicks off one of the best runs any director has had. I think one of the reasons it’s a les discussed Hitchcock is because it doesn’t have any big name stars, though the acting does not suffer because of it.\r\n\r\n\t\tI am so impressed by the screenplay here, the tension is just perfectly constructed. It has all of Hitchcock’s favorite things, from trains to being wrongly accused.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tI always appreciate Farley Granger more whenever I see him. I think in the 70s he would have been more of a star when the atypical leading man was more appreciated. I would have loved to see him in some of those gritty films as well.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tThis movie has a handful of scenes that are just masterclasses I’m directing. Specifically the fair and tennis scenes, I wouldn’t touch a damn thing. It’s so perfectly Hitchcock, and the tension is off the charts.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tI don’t think I can express my love for this movie properly, just check it out, you won’t be disappointed."

I don't care if Laurence Olivier and Joan Fontaine are happy in the slightest. He is perfectly beastly to her, valuing her primarily for her youthful inexperience and naivete while she has made the error that many young people make in identifying with someone who is incapable of loving you for who you are because they are too caught up in their own interior drama, for which they despise themselves. This isn't due to his preoccupation with his late wife Rebecca, he was incapable of understanding anything about her either, locked only into his own perspective, a shallow ignorance resulting in condescension and hatred.\r\n\r\n\t\tRebecca was made at a time when queer love was formally coded by the law, by religion, by science as deviant and wrong and had to be managed surreptitiously, frequently under the cover and locked within heteronormative relationships. The late Mrs. De Winter had as her steadfast companion Mrs. Danvers within her marriage and her affair she may have conducted to produce an heir to the estate. It seems that Rebecca may have told Maxim that she was a lesbian on their honeymoon and that their marriage would continue under that knowledge. We only see Rebecca through the eyes of those who remember her. It is important to not privilege one remembrance above any other, but Mrs. Danvers' recollection burns most fiercely, her love not only surviving death but allowed for the first time to become one with the current manifestation of Manderlay in its decor, its routine, a shrine to her beloved, and finally joining her in death. Rebecca is a ghost story where those who are left behind are haunted, even in the potential absence of a spectre.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tWhen the late Mrs. De Winter goes to town to see a doctor for her illness under the name of Mrs. Danvers, this is how I believe she truly saw herself in her actual marriage. We never see or hear about a Mr. Danvers within the confines of this tale because there is no room for such a person, if there ever was one at all.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tRebecca and Mrs. Danvers are portrayed as monstrous and inhuman, outside of the regular order of nature, even as they are forced to live within its confines, a ghastly situation which when sustained leads to terrible consequences."

It is an immensely captivating story of two men who strangle one of their acquaintances, hide his body in their apartment, and then throw a party to determine the perfection of their crime.\r\n\r\n\t\tFilmed in a manner that gives the illusion of being shot in a single take, the biggest strength of this film is how effortlessly it manages to engage the viewers in its expertly crafted plot & sustain the tension throughout its runtime even when the audience is aware of how the story will end. The direction by Hitchcock is an absolute class while the camerawork goes on to add some new chapters to the filmmaking manual.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tOn an overall scale, Rope is a masterfully directed, deftly scripted, meticulously shot, tightly edited, briskly paced, aptly scored & strongly acted crime thriller that ranks amongst the finest offerings of its genre(s) and, without a shadow of a doubt, remains a remarkable achievement in the glorious career of the legendary filmmaker. A timeless classic. A genre masterpiece. And one of my absolute favourites from the 'Master of Suspense'. Highly recommended."

Then in the 1960s entered an Italian filmmaker with his unique vision of the Old Wild West and this genre has never been the same, ever since.\r\n\r\n\t\tAn unofficial remake of Akira Kurosawa's Yojimbo, A Fistful of Dollars is the first film in what became Leone's Dollars Trilogy (also known as The Man with No Name Trilogy) and presents Clint Eastwood in his breakthrough role as a mysterious gunslinger who arrives in a troubled town torn by war between two families and schemes his way through both the sides in order to make quick bucks until his luck eventually runs out.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tBrilliantly directed by Sergio Leone who presents a more realistic look of the Old West that inspired laughter from the critics back then but later found its deserving status nonetheless, the film is expertly written too as it freshly imagines the concept introduced in its source of inspiration and places it in a western background. And Clint Eastwood's show-stealing performance & impressive screen presence birthed on screen one of the most stylish characters ever to grace cinema.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tOn an overall scale, A Fistful of Dollars is an explosive beginning to what today is rightfully celebrated as one of the most memorable trilogies in cinema history and really benefits from Leone's classic direction, Eastwood's stellar performance, ingenious use of gun violence, inventive camerawork, relaxed yet smart editing, Ennio Morricone's magnificent score and a pretty tense but awesome finale."

It's a combination of everything that made me love the cinema: Immaculate cinematography, wonderful direction, a tight and free-flowing screenplay, underlying themes woven throughout the film, pitch-perfect editing, incredible performances......\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tThis film has EVERYTHING.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tSimultaneously a gangster story, a coming-of-age fable, and an ode to aging; the film cuts between these three feelings and time-periods, all with the same characters but with each of them in different stages of development. Both physically and emotionally, the audience gets a grasp of their lives throughout the 3hr and 50 minute run-time. For most of the film, visual storytelling is the focus, bringing an ethereal and faded quality to the entire tapestry of the experience. Many moments, both grand and subtle, permeate and liven the experience. Even though most of these characters were utterly disgusting, I still found them interesting and multi-layered; and by the end of the film, I felt for them in a way that I didn't think that was possible. Truly, the ending is so beautiful that I burst into tears, and as I've mentioned before on this site; I hardly hardly cry. If a movie makes me cry, It's a keeper.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tNow, the running-time can be daunting when you first start, but 10 minutes in, you won't even care. The time, like an old Polaroid, passes in a way that almost makes you forget the first part of the film. Yet, when a particular moment is remembered, the emotion and craftsmanship comes back like a shot in the heart. I did view this over the course of two nights, because I was a little iffy about where the film was going, but I shouldn't have worried. After the second-half was over, I watched the entire film again. Trust me, this is a film that brings plentiful rewards if you view it in one sitting.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tThe direction by Sergio leone is utterly breathtaking and awe-inspiring. Forget Once Upon a Time in The West, The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly and A Fistful of Dollars; this is leone's masterwork. Basically, this is a cauldron of technical expertise and adoration of the medium. The wide shots, the extreme close-ups, the storytelling through a slight movement of the camera; the film is magical in terms of its direction.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tThe performances are remarkable, showcasing the true talents of Robert De Niro, James Woods, and Tuesday Weld in a cast of splendidly-chosen roles. Even Joe Pesci makes an appearance, albeit in a more understated and calm persona. Simply put, the glances and the silence that those glances reside in bring most of the power in this film. Remember, this isn't a film full of F-Bombs and long tirades given by Pesci; instead, It is a film full of astonishing and quiet serenity.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tThe score by Ennio Morricone, undoubtedly, is one of the finest ever composed. Sadness, nostalgia, love, temptation, and betrayal are all themes that ooze from Morricone's music. It's easily his best soundtrack, and that's no small feat.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tI can't even explain the story. It's such so meticulous, so voyeuristic, so charming, so frank, so violent, so intimate, and so freaking outstanding that I can't even put it into words. I just can't. Every moment in this story is so perfect and epic in the best possible way that I can't even talk about it right now without bursting into a state of giddy delight.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tOverall, Once Upon a Time in America is one of the most potent and daring cinematic accomplishment that I have ever laid eyes on. More than just a gangster film, Sergio Leone weaves a tale about life, love, sex, betrayal, friendship, and death; culminating in a passionate and commanding masterpiece."

I think when you’re a parent you feel the need to put part of yourself away and be a different person for your kids. Confronting your own mistakes is hard - it’s even harder to look your innocent child in their eyes and teach them that you have flaws.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tSo instead, I grew up thinking the world of them. But the older I became, the more I learned about them. And what I learned about them doesn’t make them bad people - it just makes them human. It’s hard to realize that they are human beings and not the other species you’ve always thought of parents as. And it hurts worse when your sibling realizes it before you.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tI really appreciate this movie for the family dynamics it presents here. Generational clashes and divides. The way parents can hurt their children with abandonment, neglect and disinterest. The way parents can hurt their children by being only half there.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tEvery generation only hopes they can break that cycle and do it right this time."

		"ReviewText": "Tokyo Twilight is the saddest Ozu film I've seen thus far, not to mention one of the darkest. But its pacing is exquisite, which ultimately results in a cascading effect. The film deals with the usual Ozu theme of culture clash between generations.\r\n\r\n\t\tIt is about two sisters, wonderfully played by Setsuko Hara and Ineko Arima, who've been raised by their father as their mother abandoned them long time ago. Now they're at an age where they're forced to deal with their own respective issues. Arima's character is increasingly curious about her mother after finding out that she may be pregnant. And Hara's character is a mother herself who isn't able to get along with her husband.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tThe father is played by, who else, Chishu Ryu, who thinks he's done the best he can to raise the girls but Ozu shows that isn't quite the case. He seems lost in a rapidly changing world and doesn't quite know how to deal with it.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tThe overall style here is moodier, more atmospheric. It's a rare Ozu film to be set during wintertime. And quite a bit of it unfolds during evenings and nighttime."

It takes a few minutes to adjust to the visual style, as the head-on conversations can be jarring, yet once absorbed it tends to be quite meditative. While his characters can be stiff at times, they reveal great depth of emotion.\r\n\r\n\t\tThis was the most intense of his films I’ve seen. Autumn Afternoon and Tokyo Story are much more reflective, whereas Floating Weeds has a lot of anger and resentment boiling up between the cracks. The intergenerational relationships are something Ozu captures especially well, often showing characters trying to connect but failing to give what the other wants. The setting of a quiet fishing village gives a blank canvas for the characters to fill up the space, unlike some of his other films where Tokyo has a strong presence.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tI found the father in this a very unlikeable character. While some of this was intentional, I didn’t really think he deserved to go off with the actress. He was an absent father this kid’s whole life and then tries to sabotage his love life because it reminds him of his mistakes. That being said his motivations were justified, even if I found them distasteful.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tThis is probably my favorite of the 3 Ozu films I’ve seen so far. It was quite intense, and I was excited to see what came of the young couple’s relationship.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tAlso, there’s an actress in this that looks exactly like Janette McCurdy from iCarly, it’s pretty bizarre."

It’s a fully atmospheric tale which includes reflective and philosophical characteristics and handles its central protagonists activities and intentions unsentimentally. It concentrates on a nomadic acting troupe (known as floating weeds), who seem to be individually victimised by their previous choices and a narrative which calmly formulates the impression that there’s a tinge of cosmic injustice to everything. All of Ozu's films are profoundly powerful, and this impressively exemplifies the director's visual artistry."

		"ReviewText": "Ozu is a master in captivating and engrossing the audience with ordinary, simple stories, dilemmas and predicaments faced within a family. Tokyo Story my first Ozu feature is a shining example of this trait and Late Spring is no different from the former. Ozu’s magic lies in taking ample time and weaving the story in such a manner that the viewer after about half an hour into the film feels totally at home, accustomed, comfortable, cares for the characters on screen, naturally empathizes with them and begins to feel a true sense of belonging. Coming to greater aid are the absorbing performances from the Ozu’s usual cast members who bring to the table such pitch perfect portrayals without ever allowing the viewer to question their authenticity or sincerity.\r\n\r\n\t\tLate Spring belongs to the genre of Japanese films known as “Shomingeki” which deal with ordinary daily lives of working and middle class people of the immediate post war Japanese era. The exclusive focuses of these tales are on families, their conditions, the intricate cultural aesthetics of the time and the several different problems they go through in life. Ozu narrates the story and brings out such well rounded characters which never fail to bridge a bond with the viewer. He also brilliantly interlaces philosophy and several priceless life lessons stemmed from invaluable experience without ever letting it feel contrived.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tLate Spring is based on a short novel called “Father and Daughter”. The main theme of the film is marriage and how the transformation of a new life and separation affect the parent and child in question. The Father, also a widower, played by Ozu’s favorite actor Chishu Ryu, is a hard-working man whose only worry is her unmarried daughter. In his heart he feels the same desperate pain of never wanting to part like his daughter does, but his age, experience and responsibility has hardened him, making him more focused on the job at hand and the eventual reality that his daughter has to move on from him and find a life of her own. The way Ryu embodies the character, masks his true emotions with a lie, enlightens his daughter about how love and happiness are not gifts that are showered from the heaven above but earned and convinces her to understand and accept the marriage proposal paves way for some of the most heart touching finales I have ever seen.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tThe ending silent shot of Professor Shikuchi (Ryu) in his house, engulfed by the long dreaded but never before experienced loneliness with only the memories of her daughter to keep him company effuses such poignancy and realistic emotions. This scene is all the proof as to why Ryu was such a favourite of Ozu and why Ozu is such a master class film maker. His silence spoke a million words and expressed so many untold emotions that only a man of that age can completely understand and relate with but anyone of any age with a good soul and an able brain could learn from and sympathize with.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tThe daughter, played with such effervescence and charm by the inimitable and ever beautiful Setsuko Hara, is an affectionate, extra ordinarily content woman whose greatest priority in life is her father. She is shy, caring, endearing and very down to earth. She is not averse to starting a new a life but when it comes to choosing between a life with her father at his service and a fresh new one filled endless pleasures and joys, the former comes out trumps. But that does not mean the latter has no importance or place in her mind. It is here where Ozu’s brilliance has to be noted. Hara’s character Noriko is certainly enamoured by the possibility of meeting the man of her dreams but her dilemma is further heightened by the plight faced by several women at that time, the plague of divorces. Ozu effortlessly eases us into the minds of Noriko’s character and her difficulty in making the most important decision of her life by easing into the film several incredibly nuanced characters and conversations which are authentic and natural to the Japanese era, time and culture.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tOzu’s films are not only life lessons to be held preciously dearest to the heart but also a humungous and delicious fodder for the film lover who is always hungry and eager to be served something truly unique. In Late Spring he uses what is called as “Parametric narration”. The above rigid term can be simply explained as the film maker showing us someone or some event that is seemingly unrelated or relatively unimportant to the narration in hand, in the earlier parts of the film but making us realize the significance of it through another character or a similar character motivation in the later part of the film. Here in Late Spring Noriko is critical of herself and terms her jealous because of the way she cuts pickles. But later on in the film she actually becomes jealous of her Father only to be enlightened by him in the most saintly fashion and set on the right path.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tThe theme of remarriage also plays a very important role in the scheme of things leading to eventual ending of the film. Ozu seamlessly integrates into the storyline the conflicting views that people of Japan at that time shared about remarriage. The way he uses this social theme for the progression of the film and for the unraveling of deep-seated nature, emotions and unexpressed feelings of Noriko and her Father is something to be cherished and be marvelled at.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tThe music, the static shots, the themes, the modest houses, the narrow hallways, the slow pacing, the warmth of surrounding milieu, the courtesy of the Japanese culture and on a whole his films are so beautiful, soulful and harmonious to my nature and the film lover within me that I could go on watching, embracing and revelling in the pleasure of their magical charm forever. Ozu’s films are one of the most wonderful descriptions of poetry and poignancy on screen. And I wish and yearn to watch more of them in the future."

Ever since I first saw Tokyo Story, I’ve made a subconscious habit of steering clear of his work, staggering it over the years through the underlying fear of not being able to recover. This is a mistake on my part, because out of the few films of his I’ve seen, he elicits emotions out of me that no other filmmaker is capable of provoking. For all the quintessential details only relevant to Japan; the cherry-blossoms, the social etiquette of bowing, the sitting on the floor to drink sake, it’s all in the shadow of something much, much broader — the universally understood notion of deeply rooted, familial guilt. The modern way of life is to forget our families, grow up, marry, and live contently until we have children of our own who will one day too do the same thing. Ozu reminds us of this age-old cycle, and every time his profound, low-angle framing flickers onto the screen in grainy B+W, I’m reminded that we should be the ones to break it."

		"ReviewText": "TOKYO STORY revealed secrets in me I'm almost too embarrassed to talk about on this platform, but feel they're important to process. To cite an example, my parents came to visit us over Christmas holiday last year. I'm married to a beautiful woman, we've created a beautiful child, and my parents were excited to see us after about a year of living in different states. I was just starting my Mike Leigh marathon, and when I do these runs I often become very wrapped up in the process, I'd say to a fault (I'll unpack this in a moment).\r\n\r\n\t\tMy mom loves talking with me in the evenings after things settle down, and we usually can talk endlessly for hours about a variety of subjects without feeling strained. The evenings are also really the only time I have to invest in this crazy, never-ending, cinematic hobby. \r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tI can see the scene play out painfully in my head now: Mom comes down and wants to talk right as I'm popping in SECRETS AND LIES (1996), and while I stop the show and engage in conversation, there's also a secret part of me that's anxious to get back to the silver screen. My mom, weathered in age and weirdly omniscient, can sense she's upsetting my routine. They've traveled some distance to be with us, and here I am speaking in code that I'd rather be watching a movie at the moment. Without admitting any of this or making me feel absorbed in my own affairs, she politely nods and escapes upstairs to bed. When she leaves, I feel guilty. I feel selfish. I feel preoccupied and caught up with a dizzying habit that sometimes makes me question the virtues of the project itself. I love my mom, I love my family, but I also love this all-consuming cinematic obsession, which has often led me to ponder Kieślowski's impossible question —“Family or Film?\" What a terrible choice. It isn't that my life keeps me too busy for my family. It's that I've arranged my priorities in such a way that makes it near-impossible to serve two masters. In raising a family, in spending time with real people, am I ever cutting corners or neglecting filial duties to pursue a passion? Am I too busy, too distracted by the virtues and vanities of film compulsion to spare a little more time with those closest to me? Is any film worth failure in the home?\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tIf you've read this far and have already seen TOKYO STORY, you might be seeing the parallels I've been trying to draw. In the film, parents and children are wrapped in a dense skein of disappointment, tension and estrangement, all as it relates to the busyness of life, the hospitality we give, and the little time we have to be with each other before we pass on. There's something terrifyingly true at the center that reflects a universal story: Children raised by their parents will become different over time, perhaps even indifferent to who they used to be. I will change and disappoint my parents as the seasons pass, just as they'll change and disappoint me all the same. No generation will fail to disappoint the one that came before or after it. Nothing is permanent. Everything is in flight and subject to evolve.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tThis loss is a thematic apparatus in Ozu's work that stretches back to TOKYO CHORUS (1931), I WAS BORN, BUT (1932), and THE ONLY SON (1936), pointing to how disappointment is a philosophical, even religious tenor of our existence.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tThe parents of the story are quietly disappointed with their offspring, not in any sharp or punctuated way, but in a remarkably calm and Buddhist compliance with how absorbed their children have become. Ozu never castigates the younger generation for their behavior. These kids are simply preoccupied with a very specific machine-efficiency that had come to define Japanese capitalism in postwar Tokyo. The city, and the rat race mentality to get ahead, has shaped them into the kind people their parents \"mustn't expect too much [of].\" They’re lives are busy, they mean well, but they've also grown older and have their own families to care for. Their loyalties naturally reframe the family unit to its immediate center, while widening the generational gap between their parents. Rather than spare some time and show them the sights and sounds of Tokyo, the children pawn their parents off from household to household, similar to the bourgeois children in BROTHERS AND SISTERS OF THE TODA FAMILY (1941). \r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tIn the Old Japan, children were obliged to provide for the needy and elderly members of the family. In the New Japan, when the family organization was eroding away, children may have neglected these duties under the Americanization of Japanese life. The parents in this story are a trouble to their hosts, and they know it. They're acutely aware of the changing mores of the times, as well as the family unit. Not only have their children shifted towards western notions of independence and \"getting ahead,\" but the broader culture itself has also shifted in ways that almost make the landscape entirely alien for the older generation to feel at home in. What is this New Japan, with all its smoking factories, loud music and frenetic hustling? Doesn't feel at all like the quiet seaside of the old world from which the parents came. In Tokyo, domestic, traditional interiors clash with industrial, modern exteriors, and through this clash the parents feel deserted, unrecognized, stranded without a place to call home. This might be the saddest part of watching TOKYO STORY, the fact that all of us will one day grow old and hardly recognize the world we used to call home. The young will eat the old, the old will wither away, and a place will be carved for the young to become the old and be eaten by their young, and so on.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tAmidst all this change and swirling evaporation, there is disappointment, but also solemn acceptance of what is. When the mother reflects on who her grandchildren will grow up to be, there is more polluted sadness in her demeanor than could ever be verbalized. These grandchildren will inevitably change, estrange, disappoint and become their own people. This pattern is already guaranteed in the life her own children lead, and so on down through the generations. When the father gets plastered with old friends and laments how much his children have changed, Ozu is inviting us to pierce the Zen-like veil of stoicism that had suppressed emotion in Japanese people after the war. Alcohol becomes a tool of breakthrough, an opportunity to express all the unquantifiable and unresolved emotions related to the fragmentation of the family and the failures of Meiji promises. Fish out of their own pond, the parents have not come to Tokyo to flounder in all this dislocation but to unite with their children after a long separation. The irony of how they're received culminates into a universal tragedy so moving I couldn't help but wonder how I've treated my own family and friends, especially all those times I've chosen to pursue my own interests at the expense of others. \r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\"Isn't life disappointing?\" asks a sibling. \"Yes, it is\" says Noriko smiling. Noriko's smile, which masks so much pain, has no reason to exist in this film amidst all the tragedy that has befallen her. Surrounded by the death of her husband, the ingratitude of her in-laws, and the disappointment of her husband's displaced parents, Noriko's spontaneous kindness towards this broken family is the most head-scratching thing to occur in all of Ozu's films. She's not even blood-related, a character device that was also effectively used in A MOTHER SHOULD BE LOVED (1934). Though not a genealogical relation, she plays the part of family member better than any other blood-related member of the family. Has Noriko's suffering molded her in ways her bratty in-laws haven't yet experienced? Can exquisite suffering reveal the power of generosity? Does being a widow give her a certain perspective into the loneliness her father and mother-in-law must be feeling in the New Japan? Whatever the source of her hospitality, we're amazed beyond measure by her peaceful (if somewhat resigned) acceptance of change and suffering. She is the grace note in a story punctuated by grief and hardship.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tTOKYO STORY is the kind of epic story told in the simplest of ways. It begins with parents journeying to see their children, and ends with children journeying to see their parents, and in between there are sobering lessons about despair, compassion, disaster, and resolve. \"Be kind to your parents while they're alive.\" Make time for family and friends and loved ones. Don't set yourself up for regret or embarrassment. Our families might be fractured, unhappy, in tension, imperfect, but they're also sometimes all we have. Say something kind to one of your family members. We all know how the story of our lives end, so be nicer to those we love while they're still alive."

		"ReviewText": "The first time I watched Tokyo Story its emotional core didn't really get to me, but this time around the final act seemed so devastatingly perfect. Yasujirō Ozu's sequence of static compositions manages to find a calmness in the world. He eschews melodrama and is still able to evoke a deeply emotional response in the viewer. Tokyo Story is a fairly standard film for Ozu, using some of his favourite actors (notably Chishū Ryū and Setsuko Hara) and breaking the same rules of cinema that he always does (not showing key events, ignoring the 180 degrees rule, using long pillow shots), but it's executed so beautifully here. Ozu brings up his usual themes - family, change, the struggle between the traditional and the modern - and weaves them into Tokyo Story with elegance and precision. Whilst I still maintain that Late Spring is Ozu's masterpiece, Tokyo Story is certainly a close second.\r\n\r\n\t\tFamily is the key aspect of Tokyo Story, with an elderly couple visiting their adult children who have moved to Tokyo. They find that their children have drifted away from them and must learn to accept that their children have become their own people with lives disconnected from their parents. They barely know anything about the people their children have become, and they're so distant and culturally detached despite being separated by just one generation. The parents watch on, having become tourists to both Tokyo and the lives of their children. Children will inevitably grow up and they may not ever match their parent's expectations. The parents in Tokyo Story expect a lot from their children and are disappointed, but is that just a natural generational thing or part of the cultural shift in Japan at the time? Other elderly characters in Tokyo Story are depressed about their disappointment in their children but they try to lie to themselves to prevent disappointment. They drink to excess, letting all the pain out, and their drunken behaviour only affects their families negatively. People get old and their regrets come out, but that doesn't mean they've failed. The lead couple here seem to have raised successful children but success doesn't create happiness or love. The parents are treated as an inconvenience, and even grandchildren don't want to interact with their grandparents. There's a scene with the grandmother and her grandson stood on an embankment. The young is acting unaware of the old, but the old is acutely aware that the youngster will grow old and change. Who knows what we will grow up to be, but we know that we won't be able to see the full lives of those we most care about. That moment of innocent melancholy, of wisdom facing ignorance, of a child unburdened and a grandmother lonely, is so very strange. The grandmother has already gone through all the stages of life and is now just watching someone whose journey has barely begun. The children in Tokyo Story do seem to care about their parents, but they don't ever make time for them. They want to do their own things. It is observed that \"a married daughter is like a stranger\" and the creation of a new family makes one detached from your own. The elderly parents worry about being a burden to their children, and if Tokyo Story shows us anything then it at least shows us that those who would feel most burdened by family are probably the most selfish of all.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tChange extends beyond family in Tokyo Story. The times have entirely changed and the elderly must accept that things are different. Japan has become more westernised, and we see this in logos, societal structures, and education. The people in Tokyo live with increased technology and more modern lifestyles. The elderly couple find Tokyo and its urbanisation very overwhelming; they're out of place and lost. It is a bustling city full of busy lives, and whilst the young may live fast, the old move slowly through life. The world is designed for the young and the elderly are trapped in it. It is the young who party and keep things busy, even a place of rest becomes a very lively location. Traditional family structures are breaking down in this more modern Tokyo and the elderly feel out of place. One scandalous story is told which implies a couple who slept together weren't newlyweds, it seems marriage has become less sacred. There's nothing wrong with a changing, evolving society, but Tokyo Story highlights the change of Japan during this era. It's a moment of generational divide, and such a divide can be hard to accept.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tIf Tokyo Story at first shows us the inevitability of growing up, it doubles down on that idea by showing us the inevitability of death. The Second World War lingers in the film's background, with a lot of people having lost their sons and becoming sick of war itself. Later on, we see death as a natural end, slow and protracted but ultimately peaceful. Death keeps us in check, it makes us be thankful for what we have, makes us want to be good children whilst our parents are still here, puts into focus the regrets of unloving children. But death is only a momentary reminder. Once death (and the designated mourning) is over in Tokyo Story, people go back to their selfish ways. Death is seen only as an inconvenience. The quiet death within Tokyo Story (all sniffles, no tears) feels like a build-up of guilt. There's a field of gravestones that we're each headed towards and we know we could have done more for those already buried. Death provides the end of suffering and makes the living more aware of their mistakes.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tThere is a shining ray of hope within Tokyo Story. Families become separated, change confuses us, death ends everything, but Tokyo Story provides us with Noriko. Noriko is the hidden main character of Tokyo Story. She's a kind heart who connects everything together and improves the lives of everyone else. This is not a film about a couple losing touch with their children, but one about a couple regaining a child. Noriko may not be a blood relative but she's the only character to make time for the parents. She has a communal spirit, interacting with her neighbours in a way that none of the children do, and is hence the only one who hasn't become self-absorbed (perhaps read: westernised). Everyone relies on Noriko to be the only one who cares and she's a pure soul who does so willingly. The happiest of times are not the most fancy but the times that you were shown the most kindness, and that's exactly what Noriko provides to the elderly couple. She's a subtle character, often in the background, but she's usually the harbinger of emotion. When the final scenes finally bring Noriko to the film's forefront, we finally begin to understand her. The characters condemn her lack of selfishness, wanting her to re-marry and be less selfless. But Noriko is not trying to be nice, she's lonely and often depressed and pretty certain that she's selfish. She's the only character able to see her own flaws and hence her tears are the only genuine ones in the entire film.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\"Isn't life disappointing?\" \"Yes, it is,\" replies a slightly smiling Noriko. This exchange from Tokyo Story is a culmination of its entire point. It is an acceptance that expectations will never be matched and that's just how the world is. Life would be easier if we expected less from it but people will never be better than they are. Our world is a bitter world, and we have to trudge through change and family to find any worth in it. We might wonder what the point of family is, or why families have to be so difficult, but Tokyo Story paints this inconsistent world as one of hope and disappointment. It's never going to be what we want, but that's the price of family."

The mystical aura of the screen is the equivalent of a magician's assistant, cluttering and distracting the audience from the formation of the tapestry of the entire experience. Close-up, directed by Abbas Kiarostami, is a stirring deconstruction of cinema and its various influences on society and its audience. With natural and affecting \"performances\", a faultless sense of editing, and a monstrously quintessential view on the power of moving images; Close-up is simply one of the greatest films ever made (maybe even THE greatest) and one of most extraordinary viewing experiences that I've ever had.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tFor a film to weave fact and fiction so thoroughly isn't just a massive accomplishment in and of itself. It is also a wake-up-call to every avid watcher of film and their private link between the screen and the world they reside in. That space, where the dust floats in the flickering light of the theatre projector, is a formidable specter inside all of us. Our dreams, fears, anxieties, and joys all bask in the light and flourish within this hazy gathering of glorious enchantment.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tClose-up takes this feeling, this immeasurable and almost spiritual presence, and decodes its inner workings and mechanisms. Imitation of cinema is taken to the next level. Enhanced, heightened, and enlarged; the frame is viewed as both a wistful means for empathy and a necessary character, simultaneously involving and addressing the audience. It's as if you were driving a car and instead of choosing a path in the fork in the road, you were able to transverse through both realities, watching your other self as they carry on. Feeling your existence. Watching. Observing. Waiting for the roads to intersect again.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tI remember sitting in an empty theatre one day, and although I've been alone in theatre auditoriums on multiple occasions, the aching realization that I was observing a ghostly experience continued to send shivers down my spine. Since the dawn of the cinema, we've seen people who we care about, romances which we are involved in, shootouts in which danger is felt, and moments of extraordinary pain and beauty. It is in the cinema where the world comes alive, indelibly projecting our inner feelings into a piece of art, and from there, the memory remains. Those characters float within the confines of our hearts, and although the magic act may end, we stumble out into the night anew.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tAffected.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tAwakened.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tChanged.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tThis film is a part of me."

A fabricator of reality, in order to control the immediate, the susceptible, the observers. One man who takes a situation he is presented with, twists the facts, and presents them as truth. He manufactures a role, and draws others into the world he is creating; taking normal people and turning them into participants in a thought experiment to see how much they will believe, how far can he take it before it all falls apart. Suspicions arise, but he has a gift for soothing the wary. He creates a back-story, seemingly on a whim, and strengthens his argument for his created truth with every word spoken. He is eventually caught, but the observers realize that he has been speaking in his own defense this whole time. The man has been defending his reality since he first met his gullible audience.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tOf course, that liar is not Hossain Sabzian, but Abbas Kiarostami.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tIt's difficult to explain how exciting the concept of Close-Up is to me on a personal level. As I've said before, cinema is most dear to me as escapism. To imagine things, people, actions, and emotions, that I know are fabricated, but presented in a way that, even momentarily, makes me forget that they have not or can not actually occur(red). A natural extension of that is metafiction. To lampshade reality, to understand that - even through escaping into fantasy - our world exists, that a film understands it is escapism, and that it knows it is being observed rather than experienced creates an amazing doubling sensation in my brain. Instead of presenting reality, it presents reality twice perceived - by the director and by the audience. Here, Kiarostami explains right away that this is \"Based on a true story,\" which announces the fiction (else why not omit the \"based on\" portion), and immediately follows that by announcing that the actors are \"Appearing as themselves\" which announces the fact. When the fact itself concerns fiction (Sabzian's constructed persona), and the fiction contains facts (the actors are the real-life participants), the elements of truth and lies fractalize, becoming too complicated to want to try and unravel, let alone remain possible to. It simply is, and straddles the world of reality and make-believe, placing the viewers in both worlds at the same time. \"This happened, but it is not happening, except when it is, or is it?\"\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tBesides a few basic bits of information (always accidentally read and immediately attempted to be forgotten), I was able to go into Close-Up fairly blind, and I am thankful for it. Reading about it afterwards and knowing that a clear separation of truth and reality (as much as I'm willing to believe) actually takes place in the film diminishes a bit of that magic, but doesn't remove my admiration for the concept. It's a mind-bending film that might seem like a courtroom drama at the surface, but quickly reveals itself to be an examination of reality and identity, initially dreamed up and enacted by an overall normal guy, and captured by a director with the insight on how to muddy the lines of truth and lies with a master's touch."

The real life con artist Hossain Sabzian played himself in his acting debut, yet ended up immortalizing one of the most iconic cinema roles in history. Despite his clear lack of acting chops, you can't help but fixing your eyes on him, either due to his unflinching, sympathetic character arc, or his admirably shy, boyish moments of emotional meltdowns with his idol Mohsen Makhmalbaf.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tDespite the genre-bending nature of the movie, Kiarostami didn't hold back with his arthouse endeavors, as is evidenced by his choices of shots that amplify the theme of the story, from a rolling can down the alley, to the plant that Sabzian holds on the poster. At core, Close-Up is still in sync with Kiarostami's filmography theme wise, which is hugely sympathetic to the sufferings of the Iranian people, and exposes the social issues in the most sneaky manner. Highly recommended."

I'm not here to convince you about the \"truth\" behind this film, because there is no true-truth behind it. I'm not sure that's what Kiarostami intended. Either way, it's one of the most beautiful commentaries on the power of filmmaking and art and imitations of life that I've ever seen.\r\n\r\n\t\tI was crying throughout the last ten or fifteen minutes over what is, in my opinion, something fake within something fake (their relationship). Often we do shed tears over the \"fake\": that's just something that we do as movie lovers. But this film is a double fake, making it all the more fascinating, but absolutely no less compelling. I hate to do this, and I usually only do it when I watch films like this, Under the Skin, The Babadook, Enemy, etc. but I have to warn spoilers for this review because I want to explain the theory of this film being more of a puzzle than an enigma. I'll try do it concisely though and draw upon just a few points of evidence, but seemingly strong points from what I can gather.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tIf you've seen the film, you know that it gradually becomes something different as it moves along. It begins a film that appears on the surface to be about two strangers, two people who don't see each other very often. The film gradually tries to disprove this by transforming into a film about two individuals who have in fact been married for the last fifteen years, and I'll be damned if the finale doesn't sell the shit out of this second potential reality, but the most heartbreaking aspect of it all is that it is the former that is actually true.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tIn truth, Elle is James' mistress, not his wife. Her son is in fact his, conceived years ago at some point after they first met (fifteen years ago), but he hasn't been present in their lives. He also seems to have a wife elsewhere, but Elle is still deeply in love with him and wishes that they were together (notice her interest in weddings throughout the film). He steps outside of the cafe at one point to speak to someone, a person that I believe was probably his wife, and the woman in the cafe says to Elle: \"He has a mistress, that's why you are looking at him.\" She responds strangely because she is in fact the mistress being spoken of. Also take note of the discussion between Elle and her son about the boy's surname; these ideas aren't just thrown into the film - details in Kiarostami's films, such as these, hold great significance. He has to leave at 9PM sharp. He has to be home, he has to return to his wife, his life... or have the boundaries been crossed, the lines blurred, the roles permanently changed? Does he stay? Ah, but films are only fleeting.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tOh yeah, and Juliette Binoche is probably the most beautiful human being to come into existence since the dawn of man."

(Well, I could use a chase scene with a car explosion, I guess.)\r\n\r\n\t\tWhat's the movie about? It's about an hour and forty-five minutes.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tAn hour and forty-five minutes of dizzying, glorious, beautiful starts and stops, ideas and emotions, reality and fiction, truth and lies, beauty and deceit. AK demands our attention, but doesn't mind if we don't watch too closely. (We are She, stumbling in late to a lecture, half-listening, life calling us away, yet not forgetting what was said.)\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tOfficially, my big interpretive stance is that the film defies any single, uniting reading that makes one of the movements (just meeting; lovers who first met five years ago; married couple on their 15th wedding anniversary) as the original and the others as mere copies. AK tells us, through Miller, from the very first scene that the copy is as valuable as the original, and then he structures the film so that no movement can be taken as the original and then used to explain the copies. Yet this is never held out as the secret key to explaining it all. Sometimes the original really is more valuable (the joke about why he is late works the first time but not the second; the hand on the shoulder is valuable even though a copy, yet it completely fails to prevent the restaurant scene that follows).\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tBut that's to play the big game of interpretation, which we are invited and encouraged to do and is oh so fun, yet we shouldn't let that overwhelm the many beautiful small moments and harmonious, resonant themes that echo through the film as well. Shall we talk about how the viewer is different at each viewing while the film stays the same? (Miller's response to She when she says the town hasn't changed is that she has.) Shall we talk about the differences between originality and origination? Shall we talk about love? About marriage? About fighting to be who we are (or is it who we want to be?) when faced with another who sees through our bullshit?\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tNo, let's drive to a composite Tuscan town, like in the movies."

A few films that immediately come to mind are Truffaut's The 400 Blows and Pialat's L'Enfance nue. While sure, Where Is My Friend's House fits in the same category as those films in a sense that it also features a bunch of shots of a little boy running around in a world full of mystery.

Here's another one to chalk up to digital cinema: because of the sharpness and shallower depth of field of most digital cameras, digital captures reflections much better than 35mm. (see also: Road to Nowhere, Jersey Boys). And there are reflections galore in this movie, identities constantly shifting and on the verge of collapsing on one another. Kiarostami's venture into urban spaces also lapses into his car sequences, and reflections feature much more prominently and more effectively than in Certified Copy. Reflections are everywhere, the city-scapes of Tokyo are inescapable, figuring here almost expressionistically; IMO two car sequences, the first being the taxi one, the second being the one where clouds dominate the entire windshield of the car may be Kiarostami's highest formal achievement.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tThere are bursts of humanity here and there, but rather than compare to Ozu, as many have done, I'd rather compare to Mizoguchi. In fact, this movie is highly critical of Japan, quite daring for someone who is not a national. The boyfriend constantly talks of patriarchal values, of pleasing the family. He never once wonders if Akiko even loves him back. And its this contrast, these feudal values with this modernist city which make the film (and the reflections of the city) constantly seem on the verge of collapse as well. The boyfriend too is a classic masochist male: his desire for marriage is because of his fear of losing Akiko.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tBut everyone is at fault here. The first lines of the film are, \"I'm not lying to you,\" spoken by Akiko, who is of course, lying. It's the inverse of Certified Copy: every relationship is based through some kind of lie, but this doesn't end up becoming a new sort of truth like in that film. Instead, and new from Kiarostami, doom is constantly impending. I love seeing a filmmaker go into such a brazenly far direction from their previous work, I'm now more excited for his Chinese film more than any of his films previous. I suppose the films notorious denouement is even more shocking for people who are big fans of Kiarostami's work, I remember walking down the street after my first viewing of the film, unable to collect my thoughts because I was so shaken up by what I had seen.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tIndeed, a brick goes through a window. The glass is broken, there are no more reflections. Feudal values through Modernist architecture. Perhaps Kiarostami's original title was more suitable: \"The End.\""

Phones ring and lead to useless, annoying conversations; as a taxi circles a train station plaza so Akiko (Rin Takanashi) can catch a glimpse of her grandmother, a van pulls into the POV shot and inches along with maddening consistency, persistently blocking a view of the old lady. The opening sequence is just shot-countershot, but you spend the whole first shot trying to figure out who's speaking, only gradually determining that the voice you're hearing isn't attached to anyone you see but someone behind the camera, or maybe somewhere else entirely. Mise-en-scene can be altered entirely by the addition or subtraction of bodies in the first shot, while Akiko sits alone in hers, a momentary spectator with no agency waiting to have her gaze directed.\r\n\r\n\t\tThe rush of unnecessary detail is both perversely scintillating in its own right — just trying to figure out why what was on-screen was there made my brain hurt — but the essential information is already present in the first scene, where Akiko's forced by her pimp, against her will, to take on a prostitution gig on a night when she'd rather see her grandmother and study for her sociology exam. (Cf. Liquid Sky: \"Seems to me that too many men today are telling me what I want.\") Patriarchy and oppression's not a new subject for Kiarostami, obviously, but locating its particular manifestation in a new society has produced an obdurate new form.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tFor a guy who's built so much of his career on long driving sequences, it's hilarious that the hour-long journey from Tokyo to wherever the professor lives (didn't catch the name) is almost entirely elided, with Akiko and the film sleeping through much of the trek; the film builds to a climax through automotive dysfunction. In a parking garage, the professor meets a student from 30 years ago, who's \"interested in violence in society\" (Thesis Alert, protests Keith Uhlich, but at least the guy didn't say \"the patriarchy in society\") and was once a cop but now he's \"freelance\" (in what? Viewing companion adroitly suggested he's a hitman, since he's apparently a regular at the garage for mysterious dents in his car).\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\"Now that Kiarostami has made a movie with a jump scare, anything is possible,\" Eric Kohn tweeted from Cannes. Like The Wedding Suit or Taste Of Cherry, Like Someone In Love can go from zero to excruciatingly suspenseful in 5 seconds with zero advance notice. The threat of something horrid happening throughout — especially when the prof's at the wheel, going into reverse while seemingly unaware of little kids behind the vehicle or nodding off at a red light — is finally delivered upon. This is effectively a movie that wonders about a society in which an abusive fiance can \"confront,\" with barely suppressed violence and much arm-grabbing and yelling, his would-be future wife in a wide open public area and not merit a glance, let alone an intervention."

When Old Man says \"Don't worry, it'll all work out - What will be, will be,\" of course the whole circumstance falls apart, precisely because it does work out, and what \"will be\" happens. It's not emotional manipulation, it's mechanical law. Frankly, maybe the most perfectly constructed film - and fascinating in how it seems to only establish character, situational and thematic dynamics and merely let those run to an inevitable conclusion, shocking as the ending may be. Not to say the entire film is the script - far from it: in terms of composition, shot geography and revealing just enough visual information, Kiarostami is working on a level that seems near unfathomable."

No dialogue in this particular scene, but you can tell the girl was screaming for help. Let me out! Let me out! Akiko felt like a tourist in her own city, out of place and all alone.

Yet the camera kept a certain distance from her, refusing to get close, as if loneliness is contagious. Her face just far enough for us to not be able to make out her expression. Was she crying? Was she sad? Like Akiko, we kept craning our necks, looking out the window, looking back at her, hoping that we could at least catch one glimpse of forgiveness in her face so Akiko can finally forgive herself too. But, alas, the taxi kept on driving ahead.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tLike someone in love, I am swept away by Abbas Kiarostami's simple yet wonderful and compelling visual style. It may be slow in pace, but I think that is only because Abbas wants us to take our time and really absorb everything that is shown on screen.

She almost turns the page but then the shooting resumes – or rather repeats itself – and her lingering hand falls back onto the page.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tBoth the shooting and Hossein’s repeated failures seem to be products of stagnation but in truth they are its opposite. The film they shoot is about life after the earthquake of 1990. Hossein’s story is about life held up by the hope of love. Both stories are at a standstill because of the bridge that connects the two: love. In real life, Tahereh is impassive towards Hossein’s advances, suspending their story of love on a frayed string. In the film, she won’t act in any scene together with Hossein because of her real-life impassivity, thus halting the progression of the shoot. Stagnation and repetition – but only on the surface.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tThe shooting and Hossein’s story paint life as repetition, but it is in its repetitions that life moves forward. This is the key to Kiarostami’s cinema. He speaks the language of repetition but proposes an exit out of it. The trick, however, is that his exit is ever ambiguous. He understands life’s only truth: that every word we say, every gesture we make bears the weight of ambiguity with it. It is a burden both of lightness and of heaviness. Whenever you make a choice or ask someone to make a choice that affects you, it frees you from your current stasis but hurls you into the next. Lightness and heaviness. Life is like that. Love is like that. Hossein asks Tahereh to make her choice: 'If you're too shy to say yes to me, turn the page in your book. That will be my answer.' She never speaks to him throughout the film. She doesn’t make her choice, we don’t see her choose between a life with Hossein or without him – then.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tThe ending brings Tahereh’s choice to fruition. It is a choice of ambiguity. We never witness it but we feel close to it nonetheless. Kiarostami brings us close to these two people exactly by distancing us from them. In the film’s last long take, he films his subjects from afar but brings the scent of the olive trees right into our nose, simultaneously making us separate from and one with Hossein and Tahereh. She never even speaks to him. When she does make her choice, we presume that she does speak, only we never hear it. By making us not hear what she says, Kiarostami assures us that love and heartbreak aren’t found in empty words, but in gestures of intimacy that exist between two people and two people only.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tThe story of Hossein and Tahereh is a story of intimacy we are fortunate enough to witness. We never see how it continues because the rest is a story that concerns only the two of them. It is both a continuation of the repetition before it – and the start of a new cycle of repetition. Kiarostami draws us close to the lovers so that we experience what they experience, so that we'll be able to reflect it back on our own lives after we cease to be observers of their love. We see the beginning of their story, but Kiarostami draws the line where we inescapably have to return to our own bodies and appreciate the experience in our own reality.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tThe repetition is thus extended into our lives and also enrichened by our own subjective shaping of it. 'If you're too shy to say yes to me, turn the page in your book. That will be my answer.' When Tahereh makes her choice in the end, we never see what she answers. We never see how she breaks her repetition. Her choice remains ever ambiguous, ever repetitive. Just like love. Just like life. But by being part of her repetition for the duration of the film, we are provided with the means to break it in our own lives.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tOne of the best films of all time full stop. The world didn’t deserve Kiarostami."

		"ReviewText": "Obviously, And Life Goes On is a metatextual follow-up to Where Is The Friend's Home, before becoming what was only chapter two of what is now known as the Koker trilogy. But the establishing of the three films as a trilogy, while an obvious move, distracts from how each of Kiarostami's films are either a variation of the last or a synthesis of some sort - Where Is The Friend's Home is a fiction work set around a school day, Homework is a documentary on the education system. Close-Up is step 3: a synthesis between the formal and structural techniques of Where Is The Friend's Home and Homework - a fiction work on documentary. And Life Goes On is step 4: a synthesis between Close-Up and Where Is The Friend's Home.\r\n\r\n\t\tWe can see from the very opening shot the insistance on forward movement, whether they be cars or something more natural as we see later on. And more than Close-Up even, it's a pivotal work in Kiarostami's beautiful movement from classicalism to modernism - even if the increasingly mechanical nature of his films is already implied within Where Is The Friend's Home by sheer virtue of construction, Homework is open about its desire to be nothing beyond a talking head documentary, while Close-Up virtually defies writing, letting us linger in acknowledging the wonder of cinema itself. And though it's the subject of Close-Up, And Life Goes on constantly makes the mechanism of cinema apparent - though in the complete opposite manner and very literally, since the production of Where Is The Friend's Home and its aftermath is literally the films plot. Kiarostami's reflexivity will become increasingly more sophisticated later on (really as soon as the next film) but the purpose it serves here regardless is also to play into the films subject clearly in its title. Life has moved on since the film. Life will continue to go on after the earthquake. What's nice is that Kiarostami essentially places us in the director's chair, with the main character being a stand-in for both him and the viewer, as they merely *look* at things. Natural disasters, untainted beautiful landscapes - sometimes beautiful, other times ironic, and sometimes both. And people working and moving on through all of it. And Life Goes On is nearly as difficult to write about as Close-Up, but not because it pursues ineffability as the previous work did, but rather because it feels so utterly perfect.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tKiarostami has been compared to Hitchcock before - and they are arguably the two most manipulative filmmakers ever - and And Life Goes On immediately resembles Rear Window as the first section very literally cuts between the drive and interjections through a window upon which we don't just see that \"life goes on\" but even moreso gifting us vignettes which allow us a glimpse into a character or a person as they move on with their individual life. Yet like Hitchcock each of these mini-vignettes, at least early on, ultimately draws us not to know a character better but rather to the unabashed pure joys of voyeurism, as these are just glimpses after all. Yet, (as though expanding from the limitation of this technique itself) Kiarostami expands this approach to the point where the drive itself is stopped as to meet characters and people, have brief conversations, get to know someone a little better, and explore how a society confronted with tragedy moves forward in microcosm. As the drive has stopped, so too has the seeming purpose of the film to find the two boys, and so apparently the metatextual element between Where Is The Friend's Home and And Life Goes On has thus been abandoned as well.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tBut come on, we all know that Kiarostami is much too clever for that: life moves on from a film in it's own corner of reality too, as evinced by the glimpse of the maze like hill that the boy from Where Is The Friend's Home runs across, or when the director finally finds one of the boys from that film, or when the director finds the old man from that film and it suddenly becomes unclear which layer of reality this film takes place on (obviously, the filmic one) as he begins to espout both the films theme and its reflexive purpose as well. And most beautifully, when we briefly return to the small forest and the director says hello to a baby before being called back to his car. Yet the camera remains, and the child's grandmother rocks the child. \"Life goes on,\" from and within a film and Where Is The Friend's Home reflexively becomes a film within a film even though we never see a foot of it, we only see things that remind us of it. So naturally, the destination hardly matters. But (and unlike later Kiarostami's) the film never really places this mechanic upfront, it's just kind of *there* as with the uninterrupted continuations of peoples lives, or just the sheer beauty of wind blowing through greenery on a summer day. And while there are later films of his I prefer, it's because of this that And Life Goes On earns its profundity, which is a rare achievement in movies. It's why the film remains moving and powerful even with the sheer brutality of which the events of the Earthquake are recollected by some of the survivors. Kiarostami can avoid sentimentality and melodrama and still have his point be made and still have that be emotionally effective in tandem with that point because of the sheer perfection of how that mechanic functions throughout the film. Even if by his next film Kiarostami will focus on how even aspects of this and these interactions are manipulated (now to draw attention to the mechanism itself), surely Kiarostami could not manipulate a sunset with his means circa 1992. But the sun sets as always at the end of each day, and then it rises again - of course, because life goes on. A colleague writes \"It is astounding to see how Kiarostami can do so much with, what would seem when described, to be so little.\" The key is not \"so much\" but rather \"what would seem when described, to be so little.\" The entire point of the film is the profundity of \"what would seem when described, to be so little.\" And it's a profundity that is both achieved and earned, because of the mechanism itself. Few films can attest to having every piece seemingly fit together so perfectly.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tFrankly, And Life Goes On feels like the kind of work that comes at the end of ones career - a full artistic summation on how one views life. Eventually every act, every character entering a frame, or wind blowing through trees seems like an absolute miracle - because the film trains you to see these things in that way. The fact of the sun setting is something that is never highlighted (I'm referring to when the director drops his son off to watch the game), it's just there. But if you've been watching the film by this uncommonly generous director, you will notice that it does, and how that plays into every thread of this movie. All the pieces working, and also making pieces work - this is the beginning of Kiarostami discovering who he was as an artist.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tAnd Life Goes On is a movie about the present, because the future doesn't yet exist, the past has existed, and only the present exists. And yet life goes on and moves forward, because life *is* to move forward."

This is more Buster Keaton or Chaplin than Ozu.\r\n\r\n\t\tI Was Born, But… was created in the early 30s and as such was one of Ozu's first proper feature films, 21 years before the majesty of Tokyo Story graced the silver screen. As a story-boarded silent film it's very different of course, and yet shows the familial, child-like approach for which the director later became known, along with his obvious talent for framing. A director 'in the making' if you will.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tThis is a simple tale of growing up that reminds us that little boys can be awful creatures, while retaining maximum cuteness at the same time. There's one scene early on with a bunch of bullies setting about a young kid who, despite the age, location and events being entirely different, reminded me of times as a little runt growing up and getting into mischief myself. Ozu seems to do that with all of his films. He's just so relatable.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tMuch later in his career, he delivered the equally youthful Good Morning, a film similar to I Was Born, But… in many ways, but with a career full of directorial tips and tricks under his belt feels somehow more complete. Full circle then for a Director with 35 years of active production, and who is generally considered as one of the most influential filmmakers of all time.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t---\r\n\t\tJapanuary - 7.

		"ReviewText": "\"It would be ideal if love and marriage always went together, but even if not, life is still worthwhile.\"\r\n\r\n\t\tTo begin with I have no firsthand knowledge of Japanese culture, added to which I am very much a Yasujirō Ozu novice—counting Late Autumn (秋日和) I've now seen three of his films. Though perhaps devotee would be a more apposite descriptor since what little I've seen has inspired great interest. To this end I recently sourced and devoured legendary screenwriter/director Paul Schrader's Transcendental Style in Film, an astounding critical survey—undertaken prior to Schrader's Hollywood career—which meticulously analyzes Ozu's films (as well as those of Robert Bresson and Carl Theodor Dreyer) in relation to their cultural and metaphysical origins. Though I will spare you an entire reformulation of his thesis, I will reference certain subjects regarding Ozu's work and Japanese culture more broadly; all of these subjects were gleaned from Schrader's indispensable volume.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tOzu regular Setsuko Hara stars as Akiko, a captivating widow approaching middle age while residing amicably with her young adult daughter Ayako (Yôko Tsukasa). At an annual memorial to mark her late husband's passing, she reunites with a waggish trio of his old school friends—Hirayama (Ryūji Kita), Mamiya (Shin Saburi) and Taguchi (Nobuo Nakamura)—who assume the position of nosy matchmakers after advising Akiko on the importance of getting her daughter hitched.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tMeanwhile Ayako resolves to remain fancy-free, fearful of the deleterious effect her married departure might have on Akiko's well-being. Rather than simply letting the matter drop, the intrepid Cupids conceive a double marriage plot in which their own resident widower (Hirayama) will wed the winsome Akiko, thus paving the way for Ayako's marital bliss. Naturally this doesn't come off quite as anticipated, but a combination of sage counsel and life experience enables all parties to receive their fortune with a measure of equanimity.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tLike most of Ozu's post-war films Late Autumn takes the form of a shomin-geki, a genre dating back to late-1920s Japan that uses conventions of light comedy and melodrama to gently satirize the domestic and professional lives of the plebeian or lower-bourgeois citizenry. In Ozu's case this usually involves an intergenerational household, allowing the director and his longtime screenwriting collaborator Kōgo Noda to explore wide-ranging cultural themes through the dynamic microcosm of a single family. A major such theme that usually goes unspoken but is clearly at play in Ozu's films (including Late Autumn) is the generational divide exacerbated by the modernizing influence of the United States in post-war Japan, represented through the prioritization of personal independence over familial obligation common to youths of the après-guerre generation.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tAs an aging proponent of time-honored Japanese culture (in particular the tradition of Zen art), Ozu's sympathies tend to lie with the older parties. Still he is far from a curmudgeon—or worse yet, a reactionary; instead Ozu gently undermines younger characters' appetite for individuality by subtly stressing the impermanence and triviality of human life—especially when in a state of disharmony with their environment (e.g., cutting to a static shot of a majestic mountaintop following a petty quarrel).\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tExcluding an abridged, one-sided spat between Ayako and Akiko, this sort of ironic editorial juxtaposition is the closest thing in the film to traditional conflict as perceived by Western audiences. In describing his intentions with Late Autumn, Ozu lays out a cinematic aesthetic that stresses the revealing nature of the quotidian, \"I want to make people feel what life is like without delineating all the dramatic ups and downs.\" With that as an ethos, can it come as any surprise that Ozu became a cardinal influence on the ruminative likes of Wim Wenders and Jim Jarmusch?\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tOzu's advocacy of the Zen emphasis on unity between man and nature is every bit as evident through his compositional practices as it is through the screenplays of his films. His uniformly static shots are generally frontal and taken from an unusually low height of approximately three feet. Prominence is given to pictorial balance, featuring artfully concentric framing reinforced by the conspicuous vertical and horizontal axes of doorways and windows. Nothing is done to detract from the tranquility this equilibrium is meant to produce. Not only are actors forbidden to emote a la Bresson, their most casual movements are restricted in order to better cohere with the visual environment.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tThe following report from Schrader betrays Bresson-level obsessiveness with letting the mise-en-scène do the work: \"Ozu's actors report that he would force them to do the same scene twenty or thirty consecutive times until any hint of nuance or subtlety had been frozen into rote, automaton-like action, and only then would he approve the scene for final shooting. Actors were forbidden to make even natural actions if these disturbed Ozu's composition.\" Still it's worth noting that despite the remarkable similarity of their methodologies, Ozu's scenes convey deep human warmth in a manner completely incompatible with Bresson's trademark dispassion.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tThough studded with delightful bits of humor, the overriding impression left by Late Autumn (and indeed by each of the three Ozu films I've had the pleasure to see) is one of merited quietude, a profound melancholy born not of self-pity but of a hard-won acceptance of the natural order. As an American totally unschooled in the principles of Zen this strikes me as rather a novel sentiment, though in fact it correlates with a popular Japanese concept known as mono no aware (\"the pathos of things\"), which Schrader describes as a sort of gentle sadness attending the recognition of transience as the reality of life.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tSome stray notes:\r\n\t\t-THE CHANTING WENT ON FOREVER\r\n\t\t-YES, THE MONKS WENT A LITTLE OVERBOARD\r\n\t\t-IF GIVEN A CHOICE, I'D TAKE THE MOTHER\r\n\t\t-YOU MEN SHOULD HAVE BOUGHT APHRODISIACS, NOT COLD MEDICINE\r\n\t\t-IN MARRIAGE YOU EVENTUALLY JUST GIVE UP\r\n\t\t-I DON'T WANT TO SEE HER WITH SOME ODDBALL\r\n\t\t-EVERYTHING HE TOUCHES TURNS INTO A FARCE\r\n\t\t-NOW I KNOW WHY YOU NEVER CATCH COLD\r\n\t\t-THE MEN GET WORSE THE LONGER YOU WAIT\r\n\t\t-EVEN GOT A LITTLE WEEPY ON ME\r\n\t\t-LIKE A DELICATE FLOWER BATTERED BY A RAINSTORM\r\n\t\t-OUR HUSBANDS ARE CADS\r\n\t\t-NOW IT'S ALL ROCKABILLY AND ELVIS PRESLEY\r\n\t\t-I WAS SECRETLY HAPPY FOR YOU\r\n\t\t-I SEE YOU'VE PERKED UP AGAIN\r\n\t\t-YOU STILL HAVE TO PAY—NO MATTER HOW MUCH WE EAT"

		"ReviewText": "I am sheepish to admit that Late Autumn is my introduction to Yasujirō Ozu, yet I somehow experienced a vague comfort watching this film. Nestled by the divine symmetry of his anchored compositions, I was quickly seduced by the sublime mise-en-scène and ethereal actors depicting a reworking of social satire and family drama I know intimately as a Jane Austen devotee. Ozu is famous for his narrow focus on evolving domesticity, marriage and generational disconnect, probing those themes in microcosmic detail while offering an overarching commentary on Japanese society at large. Austen, too, wrote exclusively about love, marriage, family, community and socioeconomics through critiques of the landed gentry in late-18th/early-19th century England, often exploring the dependence of women on marriage in the pursuit of favorable social standing and economic security. Late Autumn feels soul-tied to Austen’s novels by motif and decorum, but transposed onto the ‘economic miracle’ of post-War Japan with a softer irony and a more introspective spirit. \r\n\r\n\t\tLate Autumn elliptically follows the faulty attempts of three older men, Taguchi (Nobuo Nakamura), Mamiya (Shin Saburi) and Hirayama (Ryuji Kita), as they help Akiko, the widow of a late friend, marry off her daughter. Setsuko Hara stars as the amiable relict Akiko, who reminded me keenly of Austen’s Jane Bennet—the eldest and most elegant of five daughters, patient, kind, talented and understanding with an enduring, forbearing spirit. Her daughter, Ayako (Yôko Tsukasa in a nuanced performance), seemingly indifferent to her astonishing beauty and the societal expectations of an eligible young woman, respectfully but repeatedly opposes the pushy connubial agenda of her late father’s cohorts. She is reluctant to desert her mother and start life anew, fearing marriage may separate her from friends, family and possibly her own identity.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tFrom what I understand, throughout Ozu's career his growing formal exactitude encouraged an urge to simplify, to strip everything down to an austerely gorgeous minimum—the signature ‘tatami shot’ using a stationary camera positioned only a foot or two off the floor; the rigorously segmented, grid-like framing; the carefully, even obsessively layered depth of field; every gesture—the ritual of pouring tea or sake, the tilt of a chin, a smile, a formal bow—choreographed to enhance the essence of revered silence and emptiness integral to his overall form. Much like the tableaux of Austen’s drawing rooms, thoughtfully appointed and occupied strictly by specific time of day, populated by her female characters in such quiet contrivances—one lady painting screens or placed at the pianoforte, another composing a letter or posed reading a book, someone trimming a bonnet or finishing their needlepoint—arranged in a tranquil, balanced bouquet of feminine domesticity so aesthetically-pleasing as to be its own art form, Ozu’s striking style also manifests as a singular cinematic language—so meticulously curated that they appear as snug, neatly packed bento.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tBoth Ozu and Austen remark on society using the family portrait as a medium—life’s inevitable changes and disappointments are funneled into emotionally precise interactions between parents and children, husbands and wives, colleagues and friends (a social family, of sorts). Marriage and fulfillment therein play a dominant part in the drama of these familial discourses; as with Austen, Ozu reframes and refines his thesis over his career by recycling the thematic blueprint into a series of variations that essentially tell shades of the same story—each with an abiding wisdom about human relationships.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tWhat is so interesting about Ozu’s work in Late Autumn is his subversion of gender expectations in the larger conversation on love and marriage. In both artists’ texts, the plot, such as there is, revolves around various parties striving to secure a match for an unmarried young woman. Traditionally, as presented in Austen’s works, the matchmaking is typically helmed by the maiden’s mother or other female relation/maternal surrogate and is fraught with blunders, gossip, intrigue and setbacks. In Late Autumn, Ozu appoints a trio of middle-aged businessmen close to the unmarried woman’s late father as her omiai go-betweens. \r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tAusten and Ozu are working within fairly strict parameters of etiquette, as formality is the governing principle in professional and social interactions of their respective milieu, yet they succeed in transcending the rigidity of social discourse with mild satire and wit. These clever moments of warmth, fervor, sadness and confusion have such grace due to the cultural constraints of those social mores yet such emphasis due to that same reserved civility, especially in cross-generational address. In Ozu’s early-60s Japan, the traditional customs of a pre-War generation are confronted with the Westernized modernization of their country and their children, who were too young to remember WWII or feel its reverberating psychological and interpersonal impact. In commenting on this transfer of power from the aging parents of yesterday’s Japan to the burgeoning adulthood of their progressive children, we see a flip of gender conventions regarding the traditional construct of matrimony. Not only are the matchmaking roles in Late Autumn assigned to men, but their wives are assigned the more traditionally masculine roles of wryly humiliating their husbands for their long-held crush on Akiko. Rather than resulting to petty jealousy and malice, as the gender stereotype would suggest, the unaffected women mock and make sport of their miscalculating men, whose feminine romantic sensibilities cloud their judgement as they contrive a messy and unilateral double-marriage plot.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tAyako, however, is a modern woman who concedes that love and marriage are likely mutually exclusive and aspires to neither for the time being. She is framed with the contemporarily masculine affliction of willful resistance to matrimony; she doesn’t want to lose her independence, she seemingly doesn’t want to commit solely to one relationship and risk jeopardizing the bonds she shares with friends and her mother, nor does she want to disrupt her current domestic harmony and abandon her widowed mother. She rejects the traditional system of arranged marriages, or even the less-restrictive format of her time wherein matches could be made via scheduled meeting opportunities for the consideration of courtship, usually through a nakōdo such as a family member, friend or marriage agency. Though Ayako does end up marrying Mamiya’s prospect, Goto (Kenji Sada), it is not through the meddling trio’s amateur maneuvers, but because Ayako agreed to be introduced informally, socially through a mutual friend. She dated casually and without agenda, gradually making a love match—and even then she did not consent to marriage because of her fiercely held ideals of familial loyalty, contentment and accustomed independence. I think it is interesting and relevant to note that neither Ozu, Austen, nor Setsuko Hara ever married in real life.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tMuch like the gradual affections of many of Austen’s heroines, though their attachments may have developed into a quiet regard and love, there were obvious matrimonial impediments (though typically of essentials—rank, fortune, and/or familial reputation/approval), and the romances were born independently of the accepted conventions. Though, where Austen’s marriages are triumphs—the apogees and conclusions of her dramas—Ozu regards marriage as simply another phase of life—so quotidian that the Shinto ceremony between Ayako and Goto happens offscreen. We instead see the newlyweds posing for their wedding photo, Ayako in full, traditional Japanese wedding dress, her expression joyless—she is bound in the very tradition she sought to reject. Though she has found love on her own terms, Ayako is still trapped by the protocols of a marriage where she will have to separate from her mother and submit a part of her identity and autonomy to her husband. \r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tAkiko, through her rejection of her daughter’s scheme to remain a bachelorette and Hirayama’s proposal of marriage, transcends her newfound loneliness and sadness by embracing them—shown in Ozu’s poignant finale where Akiko accepts her isolation by acknowledging and reconciling herself to it. She quietly folds her kimono, a marker of her values, and reverently submits to the stasis of her new existence. It is the completion of a orchestrated cycle that feels nonetheless inevitable; an exploration of human nature as precise as it is compelling that vibrates with particular empathy for both youth and age, tradition and progress."

As a portrait of the cracks in traditional structures, this film is a fitting mirror image to Late Spring. The film captures the masculine presumptiveness that drives the men to get involved in relationships they don't need to be involved with, and the feminine frustrations of a life without a man in a patriarchal society. While I think Ozu's compassion is evident, I believe his focus is broader than merely the divide between men and women; he is exploring tradition (as always) and its complex affect on (then) modern society.\r\n\r\n        He's a bit direct in it, referencing the generation gap by putting in lines about Elvis and how things are different for the younger crowd over and over. The old men comment on it as much as anyone, especially in their interaction with Yuriko, who is bolder yet somehow an agent of defeating Ayako's agency. The contrast between Akiko's passivity and Ayako's also convey this idea, as Akiko is more accepting while Ayako is quietly frustrated, despite her bright smiles.\r\n        \r\n        And that's truly the most heartbreaking part. Not that anyone will be alone or that they aren't maybe with someone they love, but that their choices get taken away from them, over and over, until they simply relent. In the face of inexorable tradition, they are nearly powerless."

		"ReviewText": "Yasujirō Ozu’s Equinox Flower, so named after the delicate, scarlet-hued Lycoris radiata, is his first color outing and marks a return to comedy for the filmmaker after a 21-year stretch of straight dramas through the years of WWII and the austerity period directly following them. Though the decision to shoot in color was the studio’s (to best showcase the photogenic qualities of starlet-on-loan Fujiko Yamamoto), Ozu thoughtfully opted for German-made Agfacolor film—over studio-preferred Kodak Eastmancolor or Fujifilm—for its ability to better convey red hues. So while Ozu employs a characteristically muted palette of blues, browns, grays and greens, nearly each scene is punctuated by an injection of vibrant red—whether it be the design on a kimono or obi, the carpet of a reception hall, a modest tea kettle, floral arrangements, home furnishings, or even the shade of Fujiko Yamamoto’s lipstick—there are constant allusions to the titular ruby bloom along with the symbolism associated with the color: in Japan, red is equated with strength, passion and self-sacrifice. \r\n\r\n\t\tThese themes run through Equinox Flower and manifest, as with many Ozu films, as familial conflicts involving intergenerational struggles with communication, respect, and with progressively modernizing lifestyles outstripping tradition. A conservative patriarch (Shin Saburi) indulges a variety of love matches between young people outside of his own home, but when his eldest daughter (Ineko Arima) threatens to deny him the parental honor of arranging her marriage by choosing a betrothed without his knowledge, counsel or blessing, he becomes an obstinate and reactionary tyrant. Though he openly admits (in the presence of his long-suffering wife, played inimitably by Kinuyo Tanaka) that he himself would have been grateful to choose his own bride, his romantic and ideological inconsistencies dominate the central crisis. Saburi’s confounded and cantankerous Wataru overpowers the will of his daughters and wife, but he presents a kindlier, more understanding image of a contemporary father to his friends’ adult children, especially regarding the affairs of mischievous beauty Yukiko (Yamamoto), contradicting himself at every turn and shutting out his family in the service of maintaining his pride and authority.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tWhile there is the impression of even-handedness, it is clear that Ozu sympathizes with the youth (and women) of the film—wryly satirizing traditional parental authority by rendering Wataru a hypocrite who is manipulated and outwitted by his young confidante Yukiko and softened by runaway Fumiko’s (Yoshiko Kuga) sober conviction in her love despite her father’s objections, but transforms into a pitiless despot regarding his daughter Setsuko’s (Arima) flourishing relationship with an honorable and kind colleague. Ozu also makes a caricature of Yukiko’s mother, Hatsu (a delightfully flamboyant Cheiko Naniwa), a woman so hellbent on marrying off her spinsterdom-approaching daughter that she admits herself into a hospital in order to engage Yukiko to a doctor’s assistant (and when that fails, a pharmacist). Kinder with Tanaka’s dutiful matriarch Kiyoko, Ozu still manages to display her blithe nostalgia for the war-torn days of yesteryear—she reminisces on the simplicity of their lives during the war and the value of the family connection all while casually compartmentalizing out the anguish, fear and hardships the family endured at that time. \r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tAlthough Ozu’s characters may be confronted by tumultuous discord, they always respond with an inner calm, enforcing the sense of tranquility expected of his fare. The strife is requisitely quelled—though never with a cloying sense of whimsy—and the characters forge new trails to explore with richer understanding and more life experience; Ozu’s characters continue to grow. The Lycoria radiata, or equinox flower, also develops slowly—its blossom signaling the arrival of autumn—and usually flowers in response only to heavy rainfall (earning it the sobriquet ‘hurricane lily’), an apt and poetic metaphor for the struggles and growth of Ozu’s crimson garden and his assortment of late but graceful bloomers."

		"ReviewText": "Equinox Flower is not the first film in which Ozu dealt with changing nature of society and relationships in '50s Japan, but it's certainly among his more convincing, especially when compared to his previous effort, Tokyo Twilight.\r\n\r\n\t\tThe film is about a stern, workaholic businessman Hirayama who hypocritically sympathizes with the dilemmas of the young as long as they aren't his own brood. He's the sort of Japanese patriarch who advises young people to pursue love over marriage, but when it is his own daughter's sudden, unexpected engagement he isn't very pleased. He is one of Ozu most memorable characters. Maybe it's because the conflict he he struggles over is still relevant today.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tThis is certainly one of Ozu's most gorgeous films. It's actually his first in color. I loved the incorporation of browns and reds into the color palette. They especially looked great on the big screen. Ozu's shots are like paintings.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tIt's also Ozu's first comedy in quite some time. There are some hilarious scenes here, particularly those involving the young coworker at the bar. The wife is also a fun character because she's able to read her husband quite well. The domestic scenes are very well rendered, as one would expect from Ozu. It's interesting that the husband becomes less progressive as soon as he walks through the door at home.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tThis film is essentially about dealing with the progressive and conservative sides of your heart and mind, but it shows that one has to change with the times, no matter hard it might be. And it's very understanding in that regard and sympathizes with the protagonist.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tTruly a great film by anyone's standards."

The only other Japanese director I can say that about is Mizoguchi.\r\n\r\n\t\tContrary to popular belief, Ozu didn't want to shoot this film in color. He didn't want to shoot any film in color. But he gave into studio's demands. As you would expect, his use of color is a bit awkward and not particularly subtle. He didn't exactly use every color in the book, but he relies on a few quite a bit. It helps him that this is one of his more static films.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tGenerally speaking, Ozu films are variations on a theme. In postwar years, the tension between tradition and modernity became a key one for him This film is one of his most important in that regard.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tLate in the film, the protagonist meets his old friends for a class reunion. One of them is urged by the others to sing a traditional song. At first he refuses, saying that there is no longer place for this kind of thing anymore, but eventually he relents. He sings an old poem, emphasizing traditional mores and values. After singing a few verses he stops and refuses to go on. In the very last scene the protagonist is seen on the train, now going to meet his daughter, and quietly singing to himself the same old song. Times have certainly changed, which even he has had to acknowledge, but it is still not easy for him to give up his core values. He'll remain who he is even when trying to please others.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tIt's a bittersweet ending. Ozu wants us to feel the pain this man is experiencing. It's easy to misread it, though.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tOzu's best movie since Tokyo Story, Equinox Flower is spare and compassionate portrait of aging, transition, and change."

		"ReviewText": "For someone who never married or had children and spent most of his adulthood living with his mother, it is rather noteworthy how keen an insight Ozu Yasujirô offers in this film through the behavior of his protagonist, Hirayama Wataru (touchingly played by Saburi Shin), toward his daughter (Arima Ineko) upon learning that she wants to get married. While the differences in class (between the family and the prospective husband) and ideology (the hitherto secret relationship; the manner in which Hirayama becomes aware of the couple's immediate plans) certainly play a role in his initial refusal, Ozu also hints at something more primitive: a jealousy or rivalry based on the fact that another man could supplant him in her life.\r\n\r\n\t\tOzu only accentuates this notion by depicting how level-headed and pragmatic Hirayama tends to be when dealing with the daughters of others who are in a similar position. And early on, at a wedding, he even laments the circumstances of his own arranged marriage and congratulates the new couple for following their hearts. Yes, he is indeed \"inconsistent,\" as his wife (the great Tanaka Kinuyo) rightly points out, to which Hirayama sternly responds, \"Everyone is inconsistent now and then, except God. Life is full of inconsistencies. The sum total of all the inconsistencies of life is life itself.\"\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tAnd it is this self-awareness that makes him such a complex and memorable character, one still trying to fly the flag of the increasingly outmoded customs and values while being cognizant of their quaintness. Which also renders Hirayama a more modern figure than, say, the father played by Ryû Chishû in An Autumn Afternoon, who more or less remained oblivious. But that alone doesn't save Hirayama, as to Ozu he too cuts a pathetic figure: a medium shot of him angrily pacing back and forth in his undergarments is a comedic highlight.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tThe first of six color films Ozu made at the end of his career, Equinox Flower successfully illustrates his future penchant for highlighting the color red (part of the reason why he chose Agfa color). The emotions remain movingly subdued, however, as proven by the poignant shot of Hirayama in an empty train late in the film."

It is lighter, has less astute observations about humanity and, at 100 minutes, feels overlong.

I do, however, feel very comfortable pronouncing it absolutely wonderful, full of strong, subtle performances and a couple of scenes so emotionally intense that they make it hard to breathe.\r\n\r\n\t\tTelling the story of a dapper, absurdly handsome gangster named Joji (Joji Oka), the film tracks his life and future through his relationship with two women: Tokiko (Kinuyo Tanaka), his modern, good-time girl moll, and Kazuko (Sumiko Mizukubo), the demure, traditional sister of a new recruit to his gang.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tBoth Tokiko's and Joji's lives are changed by meeting Kazuko, in a way that is both aspirational and overtly romantic. Tokiko talks explicitly about \"falling for\" the woman on whom her boyfriend has become fixated, and the only intimate contact in the entire film is between the two women when, instead of shooting the interloper, Tokiko surprises them both by kissing her on the cheek. When she gets home to the flat she shares with Joji, Tokiko is absolutely giddy with affection for Kazuko, telling Joji about her newfound understanding of his fascination as she unpacks the products of the day's shopping, things chosen to bring her life closer to the one Kazuko lives.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tThis scene is, in many ways, the emotional centerpiece of the film, as Kazuko struggles to articulate the way she feels, and the dreams she has for her future with Joji. The conversation shifts from joyful hope, to confusion, to hurt and anger, all masterfully played by Oka and Tanaka: Tokiko opens her heart while Joji shuts down emotionally, terrified of showing anything for fear of what it might reveal. And yet they're in harmony in small ways, as when they simultaneously express their unspoken, shared uncertainty by fiddling with their clothing, the signifier of the modern, dangerous lives they've both chosen.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tAnd oh, those clothes! The fedoras and the suits on the men; the glorious, staggeringly stylish coats and stripey sweaters on everyone — it's fashion porn of the highest order, layered over a delightful gangster tale, told by a master."

As for his 1933 noir, Dragnet Girl, I was honestly pretty excited for it. I knew it wasn't going to blow me away or anything but I expected some good to come from it, and there is of course some good, but it just left me utterly disappointed.\r\n\r\n\t\tBy this point in time, Ozu was already very skilled and him making a gangster noir really intrigued me. I love noirs and while a genre obviously doesn't make a film great, I wanted to love this and I didn't it. Instead, I was left extremely angry and frustrated.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tDragnet Girl was Ozu's love letter to American gangster crime noirs. The man was known for making dramas about social issues and he placed hints of that here and there within this film yet this was more about showing his love and appreciation for some of the films which influenced him and helped him to love cinema more. It's honestly a beautiful thing. To adore certain films and be inspired. It's something great. But my appreciation of Dragnet Girl can only go so far.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tYou see, my main problem with this film, other than just being underwhelmed, is that it has so much potential but completely fails. I've found this to be a regular occurence with all of the Ozu films I've seen so far and I hope it doesn't continue to be like this but I keep feeling like these films have a ton of potential for being something great but they never are able to fully capture that idea and make it marvellous. They all just feel underdeveloped. With Dragnet Girl, I struggled to get into the story but managed to keep up with it somehow and by the end, I sat there in frustration because whenever an amazing scene would come up which made me so joyful, excited, and interested, that moment of prosperity would immediately be ruined by some dumb scene.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tI won't spoil anything but in the last half of the film, I was fully engaged and kept getting heartbroken. A scene would come up that I found to be simply incredible but then there would be a cringy as hell line or just a plain stupid scene. It really bugged me because you can see that underneath the cringe, stupidity, and cliches, there's certainly something great here which could even work with silent films such as this but it fails. It fails so badly.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tMy review makes it sound like my rating should probably be lower than 2.5 and that may be the case but there definitely is a lot of positives here; from the lovely camerawork to the very good two lead performances, you can see Dragnet Girl isn't horrible but I can't help but feel extremely disappointed by this. Dragnet Girl is the worst Ozu I've seen so far. No, it probably isn't even the worse but because of its underdevelopment, predictability, cliches, and frustrating waste of potential, I will say it's the weakest I've seen from him thus far. It has its moments but those magical moments were continuously shattered by something bad. Thankfully, I only have one silent Ozu left in my binge before I can move on to his wonderful talkies. I will watch his other silent films eventually so that I can complete his filmography but as of right now, I just want to get away from all this disappointment."

Placing the first (s)tone at the very first scene with slapstick comedy and a hidden agenda to make a call back at the end. Filling the flow with many emotional packages; some juxtapositions of two different moods in one frame, sincerity of goodwill, helping to hide sadness together, surrendered man swallowed his pride, and statements of each characters about genuine love. And it worked with such a charming feeling, flowing the ups and downs and ups of the flow nicely.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tPride, naivety, and false moves with good reasonings. Those are the key notes of this song about these certain families living in Tokyo. One of the lyrics are \"Tokyo, city of the employed\" and \"a drowning man will clutch at straw.\" Stating the struggle between the notes as a reflection of the hopeful characters, the first start of the overcoming and reaching the finish line.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tAnd at the third act Ozu finally pulled the string. Made a call back to raise the nostalgia on a high bar. And they were singing in nostalgia, bunch of full-spirited people celebrating togetherness and hope. Though it was hard for some people to keep their heads up, some others couldn't blame the sudden sorrow striking at the happy moment and helped them with care, love and respect.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tWhat an assembling feelings.

Before the advent of sound, this would have worked. But, now, the cadence is off and the filmmaking distances me.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tFor all of that, there's good stuff here and some great character work. It's a solid narrative with expected but well pulled off beats. Tokihiko Okada is excellent, because he's just excellent. It works better as a drama than it does as a comedy, but it is still nice to see the American silent film influences that clearly dominated Ozu's output at this point. It is Ozu just establishing the voice of Ozu, and the parts that link to that are the strongest."

He looks for work while his childrem catch stray dogs for money. They fantasise about food and do games of pretend since they have nothing material.\r\n\r\n\t\tChildren will be children, and they will find a way to exist without realising their place in the world. Ozu understood a child's worldview like few directors did, allowing him to create adult films without hyperbolic representations of childhood. His children play and learn, they grow and smile. It is children who can always find the small happiness that let the hours pass by. Perhaps that is why adults in An Inn in Tokyo wish to be childlike again, to free them from responsibilities and an understanding of society.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tOzu was the master of silent cinema. His silent films are effortlessly smooth and his style perfectly suited to a lack of sound. Ozu could have made An Inn in Tokyo later on in his career and it would still work. Though this is a rare Ozu film that contains one tracking shot! More significantly though, An Inn in Tokyo has a complexity to its characters that far exceeds many other silent films. Overall it's beautifully simple, like all Ozu films, but the characterisations are rich.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tAn Inn in Tokyo is a film of surrogate families and suffering children. In poverty, desperation takes over. Doing what is right may mean doing smaller wrongs. This is the pain the characters face. There are some dark contemplations on what it means to have nothing. This is why An Inn in Tokyo is so hard-hitting. It is devastating, a film to cry at. Yet it also has a beating heart, drawn from the belief that we can find kindness and be kind ourselves. The ending is uncertain. A man walks away from the camera, through an industrial wasteland. A soul is saved, but at what cost?"

Even Yasujiro Ozu himself uses child characters almost like a crutch, with not a whole lot of personality besides general mischievousness and immaturity, not in an obnoxious way, but not in a well developed way either. What does give An Inn in Tokyo the power it needed is Ozu's minimal, haunting direction style, and a terrific lead performance by Takeshi Sakamoto, who has played the same character in Ozu films prior, but his performance is provided particular emphasis here with such a small cast.\r\n\r\n\t\tThe still distance provided in Ozu's visual style gives a window to an honest, yet dreamlike world to reflect on in both its harsher and its softer moments. An Inn in Tokyo may not be redefining for Ozu or even as an individual work in the larger scheme of Japanese cinema, but what Ozu achieves at his greatest is what gives this film the haunting quality his work so often builds itself on. Even taking into account its imperfections, it is still a quiet and wonderful little drama."

In the Ozu films I'm most familiar with, his best-known, later work, such as Tokyo Story and Late Spring, his lack of camera movement creates a sense of poetic quiet. Even as families fall apart and emotions unravel, the world around them is simply, slowly moving on.\r\n\r\n\t\tIn An Inn In Tokyo (in inn in an in inn in), that stillness is still there. The Inn is full of guests whose lives are just glimpsed, but provide a contrast to the sadness the central family. But what caught my attention more, perhaps simply due to the fact that so much of this film takes place outside, much more than I remember any other Ozu film, besides perhaps I Was Born, But..., was the fact that when Ozu's camera sits, observing without interacting, it calls attention to all the movement I rarely notice in other films (and even in real life). From something as large as a character walking across the screen to something as small the wind in the tall grass or the way a woman's loose hair fall on her forehead, these minor movements orchestrate into something major, as dynamic as anything Gance or Murnau, but in a gentler way."

Dream like you used to.\"\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tTokiko (Kinuyo Tanaka) is trying to make ends meet while her husband Shuichi (Shuji Sano) is away serving in the army. When their son gets ill, Tokiko becomes desperate to pay the hospital bill, leading to selling her body for a night. Shuichi returns, Tokiko can't bear to lie about what she did, the drama unfolds.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tThis is more openly emotionally intense film than most of Ozu's work, bordering into melodrama. There's less restraint, perhaps to reflect the raw emotion of post war Japan. Ozu even displays some very rare on-screen violence, the first since Dragnet Girl 15 years prior. (Though even that film looked away from a brutal beatdown, leaving the climactic beating of 1932's Where Now Are the Dreams of Youth? as the last time Ozu has been so explicit.)\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tIt's heavy handed on the plight of Japanese citizens of its day, and is missing Ozu's trademark tender subtlety. The action takes place in what looks like a shanty town with new construction far off in the background. Tokiko and a friend are seen looking out a window talking about what a nice day it is -- the next shot is a view of a dump.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tThe lack of restraint teeters Ozu's normally remarkable balance between broad themes and more personal, human context. Tokiko becomes more of a symbol of the Japanese people trying to survive than being a character of her own -- she makes a desperate choice then spends the rest of the movie being contrite. Shuichi fares even worse as an angry, condemning hammer. All this doesn't mean there's nothing to FEEL, because there's plenty of that in the moment, but coming so many decades past its time there's little to impart a lasting effect.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tHen in the Wind isn't horrible. In fact, I could see why some people love its bold melodrama. But it just doesn't resonate the way Ozu's other works do."

The scene in which Tanaka's husband confronts her about what she had to do in his absence in order to save their child's life is harrowing in its intensity. More than any other film he made, A Hen in the Wind proves that Ozu could also do melodrama! Kinuyo Tanaka is terrific as always."

Actually, it's hard to say if it really is a \"lesser work\" because everything is good in it - perhaps I just made an assumption that could be turned other way around, this obscure gem that took years to find is definitely lesser seen, not necessarily a lesser film. Hell, while thinking about it and writing this, I'm raising the rating from four to five for I honestly cannot realize what could be at fault here. Perhaps only the reason that Ozu was so consistently masterful makes it hard to find \"lesser films\" and we might find flaws where they actually do not exist. Perfect film I guess."

The pendulum of responsibility between father and son keep switching with time and the idea of responsibility to the other is essential here both because it deals with teachers and because of the heavy shadow WWII lands over it. The film’s large ellipsis (some result of American censorship) also add to this feeling of searching for a whole that never quite comes."

		"ReviewText": "One of the three postwar films Yasujirô Ozu made at a studio other than Shochiku, The End of Summer does contain a few unique elements.\r\n\r\n\t\tFirst and foremost, there's the casting: while there are a few Ozu regulars in the movie, it also features Toho mainstays such as Michiyo Aratama, Keiju Kobayashi, and the irrepressible Reiko Dan, who is perfectly believable as someone who would go out on a date, with a gaijin no less, while her (possible) father is lying dead on the floor (this film generally offers a great blend of comedy and pathos). One could also add Yôko Tsukasa to the list, who appeared earlier in Ozu's Late Autumn, one of her rare forays outside the studio. (Speaking of that film, the marriage-related conversations shared by Tsukasa and Setsuko Hara, sisters-in-law and not sisters as identified by most, often resemble the same from Late Autumn, where they played mother and daughter. The lakeside scene between the two, in which their posture and body movements emphasize their solidarity, is one of the most visually sublime Ozu ever shot.)\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tThen there's the score: Toshirô Mayuzumi, the great avant-garde composer who often included western elements in his music, as proven by his scores for Mizoguchi's Street of Shame and Naruse's When a Woman Ascends the Stairs, offers one that may be more pronounced than what most viewers are used to from Ozu films, but it is situationally appropriate, which isn't always the case in Ozu. (I believe his only other collaboration with Ozu was the 1959 Good Morning.)\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tAnd last but not least, the setting: Ozu's favorite city, Tokyo, is nowhere to be found here. Instead, we are shuttled between the modern metropolis of Osaka and old Kyoto and its suburbs, where most of the action takes place. The clash of tradition and modernity is one of the themes of the film: it is eventually learned that the family-owned sake brewery will need to merge with a bigger company in order to survive.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tOzu's penultimate film, The End of Summer may take a slightly different approach in its portrayal of the passage of time and the cycle of life, but it is ultimately just as poetic and melancholic as his best work."

And then... it faded, and the melancholy returned. The impact of death is what struck me, rather than the death itself, yet again. The camera sits low as the women mourn. Their bodies are perfectly still for a moment as the world seems to freeze. As always, the melodrama is a low boil rather than a bubbling pot; these moments are the \"loudest\" and yet they are understated. A moment of grief, and then movement returns."

I'm glad you understand.\" So says Mokichi (Shin Saburi) to his wife Taeko (Michiyo Kogure) towards the end of The Flavor of Green Tea Over Rice—and that line right there not only summarizes Yasujiro Ozu's view of marriage as contingent on compromise and empathy, but also succinctly sums up the great Japanese filmmaker's complex, unsparing yet wise humanist perspective as a whole. Just when you think Ozu, after putting the Satakes' troubled arranged marriage under an alternately comic and dramatic microscope for about an hour and a half, is about to succumb to bitterness and cynicism, he surprises us with a scene overflowing with tenderness and love.\r\n\r\n\t\tWithout acceptance lies loneliness. Whether the initial passion was there or not, \"reliability\" is what inevitably keeps a marriage going. Someday the young ones will learn."
