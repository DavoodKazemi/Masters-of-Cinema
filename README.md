# Masters of Cinema
**Masters of Cinema** is a web application made by ASP.Net 5.0. Users are able to review, rate and log movies and much more. I used the website https://letterboxd.com as a source of inspiration on this project.


## Technologies
* ASP.NET Core 5.0
* JQuery
* Plain JS
* SCSS

## What it is about
This is meant to be where you meet the "masters of cinema" (the legendary directors)! It works as a source to introduce you to their movies, so you could appreciate them more.

### Masters of Cinema lets you
* Know about famous directors
* See the movies information
* Rate movies
* Log movies
* Add movies to watchlist
* Add your own custom lists
* Review movies
* And more...

### Visit the website
You may want to visit also visit https://mastersofcinema.ir, for a quick tour. Feel free to test whatever you want.

### Future plans
If I get to work more on this project in the future, I would probably make a social network out of it. Where people can interact with each other.
